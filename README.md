LIN373N Final Project: Review Score Prediction

[main.ipynb](https://github.com/krithravi/review-prediction/blob/main/main.ipynb)
contains the data prep, models, and analysis.
[graphing.ipynb](https://github.com/krithravi/review-prediction/blob/main/graphing.ipynb)
contains the `matplotlib` scripts used to graph.

The [dataset](https://github.com/krithravi/review-prediction/tree/main/dataset) contains
the training and testing sets. Its subdirectory contains the splits used for the product
analysis.
The `.csv` files were used as inputs for the graphs; on their own, they don't mean much.
