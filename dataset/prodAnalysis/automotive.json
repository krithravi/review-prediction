I have a few month old Tesla Model 3 and the TPMS indicated tires were low on pressure. All read about 37 PSI but when I hooked up this unit it read 30 PSI. I was a little skeptical but thought the TPMS sensors could be off. Aired up 2 tires to 42 PSI as indicated on the unit. I think turned on the car and one tire read 49 PSI and the other 46 PSI. I then pulled out the tire pressure gauge and sure enough 49 / 46 PSI when the unit read 42 PSI on both. I then tried another tire subtracting for the 5-7 PSI difference and found when I stopped the PSI on the gauge fluctuated about 2 PSI. This is just not acceptable.

I got this to filter out the sun and shade my baby. It looks good and does its purpose, all the while I am still able to see through my rear view mirror. However, it should be noted, that this does not go down as easy as shown in the video. Most times one side gets stuck on the clip in the headliner and you have to hold the clip so that the shade can come down. Also, I'm not sure if the tab on mine was defective or cheap, but it tore right off from the shade. This surprised me because unless its raining or I'm driving at night I leave it alone. I may have put it up and down a total of 10 to 15 times at the most before it broke. Its more of a pain now to bring up, but I never really used the tab to put it down as the shade would always get stuck in a clip. Pros: -Looks great -Easy to install -Blocks the sun, but you can still see Cons: -Durability -difficulty to put the shade down (you will need to use 2 hands, and in my case I have to use 2 hands now to bring it up as well since the tab broke) I'm not exactly sure I would recommend this product.

The warmer is not very warm and will not keep drinks hot. The holder is only 2.25 inches deep and only the bottom 1.3 inches does the actual cooling and heating. The cold setting does get nice and cold but, since it is only doing this at the bottom, and heat rises, it provides marginal cooling of your can or slender bottle. You can forget about using it to hold big fountain drinks as they won't reach the bottom of the unit which means no cooling or heating for those. It needs more engineering. First, it needs to cool drinks at least 5 inches up the sides of beverages and secondly, it needs to fit larger containers. I hope the pictures help you with your decision.

Also the second strut did not have the hardware, instructions or sticker whereas the first one did.

Quite unfortunately, it broke within a year, or just a little over. The button that attaches the heads to the handle broke off between uses for no apparent reason. We store it in a vehicle or in our house. It was great while it lasted, but it didn't last very long. SO disappointed! Original review: I bought this as a gift and they love it, and I love it. The shovel and scraper attachments are lost somewhere in the basement. The shovel is very narrow and it has a pointed tip, but it's better than not having a shovel if you keep it in your vehicle. I wish the arm was longer, but it does telescope and does reach across most of an SUV. The brush attachment has a rotating feature so you can angle the head. I purchased in Dec 2017 and just used it tonight in January 2019. Living in New England. So far so good. I have thought about getting another one for myself!", "review_title": "Love it!

I live in the Seattle area so this is a big deal. 4) Their support is sort of incompetent. They sent me the wrong parts twice.

OEM replacements go for approximately $260 each, so at $135 for the pair, these are a bargain but of course one must expect that the quality will probably not be up to OEM standards. Overall these appear to be very good quality units especially for the price. They are visually indistinguishable from the OEM units and the fit in the car is excellent. Everything lines up where it's supposed to be. The bulbs are already all included which is a nice bonus. I ran into two issues: the socket for the running light/turn signal bulb is not quite right. It's an extremely tight fit with the plug from the car's wiring harness. The plug fits very smoothly with the OEM socket but extremely tight with the socket on these units. In fact it was so tight I was not getting a good electrical connection, causing the turn signal and running light bulbs to not work properly. The easy workaround for this problem however was to remove the bulb sockets that came with these units and to simply re-use the old bulb sockets from my OEM lights which fit the new housings perfectly. No biggie. Not ideal, but not worth returning these units for. The second issue was really weird: on only the left side light, there was some kind of manufacturing or assembly error. The reflector was installed into the housing in such a way that the parking light bulb could not be removed from the housing because the hole in the reflector and the hole in the back of the housing were misaligned. The right side housing did not have this issue, the bulb went in and out no problem. In order to fix this I had to break the turn signal bulb with a pick in order to remove the socket from the housing, then spend some time with a Dremel grinding a bit of the reflector away so the bulb would fit. Again, not ideal, but not worth returning the item for. But something to be aware of as not everyone may have the skills/equipment for this kind of modification. The adjustment process was nice and smooth - the factory service manual gives the adjustment specs if you have it. Only the low beams are adjustable. There are adjusting screws for the high beams but they are dummies - they spin but don't actually adjust anything. The OEM high beams aren't adjustable either so that's how it's supposed to be. All in all these seem like decent quality items and you will be amazed at the difference in how well you can see if you have been driving with oxidized/fogged lenses. The low beam projector lens gives a nice sharp cutoff with upward angle to the right just like it's supposed to. The housings seem to be made of quality materials and the fit is excellent. It's a good buy for the price, just be aware there's a possibility you may have to make some slight modifications, which is the sad state of aftermarket parts generally these days.", "review_title": "Good Item, but a Couple Minor Quality Issues", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

Originally, Alla Lighting had these bulbs with thinner connectors (refer to the picture, the bulb on the left) that would constantly break off due to poor soldering. Then Alla introduced the \"New\" version with thicker connectors (refer to the picture) that were supposed to eliminate the breaking off problem, however, as you can see for yourself, it did not work. Overall, I have spent a couple of hundred dollars due to constantly having to replace the failed bulbs. Eventually, I had to switch to a different brand, one with a different connector design (picture on the right), which will never break off, but had to sacrifice on the brightness.

I like the size, I like the color of the back-light, but that is where my acceptance ends. I have found it quite useless for my needs in my 4Runner.

The mounting bracket is extremely flimsy and will undoubtedly break with too much adjustment. There were no instructions in the package, but adjusting the time wasn't too difficult to figure out. The Clock is very affordable and compact. It should be perfect for my needs. Sadly the amount of effort needed to see the display means too much time with my eyes off the road, which is extremely unacceptable for me. The battery life seems to be exceptional, but time will tell. The CR2032 Battery isnt hard to find, but it also isnt very common. I have tons of them because of other interest, so it isnt an issue to replace them. The clock has potential, but I think where I need it to be is where it falls short.

The install wasn\u2019t bad and it took about 3 hours. I know some reviews said it could be done in an hour but I have to assume they were working in a garage with a lift and had power tools. Between breaking the rusted bolts loose and crawling around under the truck to run the lines, there\u2019s no way I could have done it much faster. The air lines that came with the shocks were plenty long enough for my install. They gave me 10 feet of line and I used 6. The shocks held pressure for about a week and then popped a line out. During the install, I noticed that I could pull one of the lines after I thought I had tightened the nut down enough so I tightened it harder. That wasn\u2019t the one that popped out so I\u2019d recommend you check each fitting well during the install. I should have gone back and checked them all when I found that one but didn\u2019t. You should tighten it down and give the line a good tug to try to pull it out. If it comes out, put it back and tighten it more. When you think they\u2019re all good, put at least 100 pounds of pressure on them and see if they hold. I did that to all of them after the line popped and they held. I\u2019ll update my review if they pop out again. Monroe should definitely improve the air line connections. To me, that\u2019s the big issue with these. It\u2019s really tough to tell whether you have them tight enough and it feels like it\u2019s hit or miss for whether they\u2019ll hold air for a long time because of that.", "review_title": "OK For The Price", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

Tabs all around the body are too long, leaving the bulge shape appearing to float in the frame, offset and misaligned, leaving portions of the tape exposed. LR does not align level with the LF, giving a staggered appearance.. I've found that this is because the tabs are cut too long and the \"bulge\" is prevented from sitting deeper in the frame opening.

I figured that two products that were so highly rated would definitely do the job........and that's a bunch of BS because both products we're not rated properly. I went to fakespot and this is not a four-and-a-half Star product and the other one wasn't a three and a half Star product. I'm not going to mention the other products name because it looks like I'm bashing one and praising another and I don't shill for anybody.. my reviews are always true and honest. you'll find my other review if you look, because there aren't very many products that do this, and the other product will come up on the same page when you do a search. I hated that product. It's totally useless. This product actually works, but with a caveat. That caveat is the scratches have to be absolutely hairline. Mine were and although it doesn't hide them completely it certainly hides them enough to take your eye away from them when you look at the car in its entirety.. I was actually surprised. The key to this product is to follow the directions. You put it on with a swirling motion and although they say you can use a buffer I wouldn't. In my mind it might make the problem worse. U-Swirl it on with the pad that comes with it and you use light to medium pressure. The key comes when wiping it off. Microfiber towel and very very gently. That's the way it works. And I laid a coat of meguiars NXT over all those areas and I did it very gently and the product held up beneath the NXT. Anything more than a micro thin light scratch will not be affected by tinted product and it will not work. True and honest review. Heads up to everybody! Fakespot is a good app. It works trust it. This product doesn't get four and a half Stars. Fakespot shows it at approximately 3 stars.

These things are cheap for a reason, but if you are handy and have patience you will end up with awesome looking lights for not a lot of money. I ended up transplanting the original headlight brackets on to the new lights. JUST the bracket, not the adjuster screws. Yes, that means you have to undo a bunch of little screws and even drill a couple little holes to match the new adjuster screws onto the old brackets. This also required filing and cutting out some plastic to get the adjuster screw mount things to sit flush against the bracket. Once you\u2019ve got the old bracket on the new light it will pop right into place. This took 30 minutes per light minimum. The only issue with the bottom lights is the retainer tab that pops into the car is a little to tall. You can either file it down to be shorter or file the plastic slot on the car to be a little taller. I filed the car as that is much easier. You have to get it just right though other wise it will be too loose and will not stay in the slot. I made that mistake on the first one and had to use a little screw to hold it in place.

Once you pull these out from being tightly wedged into the too small storage spaces, good luck trying to get them back in.

The iPad fits great, and works fine for the child who is looking directly at the iPad, but unfortunately the child in the OTHER seat cannot see anything because of the glare off of the plastic cover. Literally, nothing, just a bright glare. I posted a question about this and got four responses saying nobody had any trouble, so I'm guessing nobody had a second child in the car. Additionally, be aware that the iPad in this holder does lie very low, even if the Organizer is secured as tightly and as high as possible to the seat. The iPad ends up resting about halfway down the setback, quite low. Despite this, it would have been very functional if the screen were visible properly from the other backseat.

Music is a bit quieter followed by answering phone calls paired to a mobile phone being almost too quiet (before moving the speakers).

Making sure the lights are working I pushed the lens into the mirror, they DID NOT snap tight.. if I slightly pushed it they'd come out.. this was a no go.. what is happening is the latch on the LED lens is not seating itself.. so what I did is pushed it in all the way, and then on the mirror side (with mirror turned up and away) I used my flat head and forced the latch to seat itself (it takes some force, it won't break the latch) and once it's seated.. the lens isn't going ANYWHERE, highway, bumps or not.. so far so good.

Kudos to the inventor/developer. PROS Fits the tab perfectly Aids in lifting tab Convenient 'always on' Will reduce spillage CONS Will not contain carbonation Will not contain spillage Does not inspire confidence in opening can Possible injury to thumb when opening can All that said, some context is in order. Initially, I was looking for something to contain the carbonation for cans left in the fridge overnight, and reduce some slight uneasiness about nearby science projects easing death into my soft drinks. These looked very simple, and though pricey at eight USD, I appreciated the clever design. Ordered even though I realized these were not intended for my use case. The work very well for their intended use, and fairly well for mine, as noted above. There is only one caveat, for which I deducted one star. (I usually don't give the fifth star until I observe a high level of durability over time. That was not this case though.) The width of the two 'tines' that encircle the tab actually *impeded* opening the can. They press on the surface of the can that doesn't open. You're instructed to press on the tab with your thumb while pulling up on the back of the Barricade. On two cans my thumb went into the opening somewhat. There were no cuts, but I can see that as a possibility, unless maybe you have wide meaty digits. Using the device to try to open the can gave me the impression it could snap at any second. I found it much easier to open the tab as I always do, then attach the Barricade afterwards. For anybody who has trouble lifting the tab, using the Barricade to lift the tab up enough to grab it without the device might be a better way to go. Aside from the price, I'd recommend these for their intended purpose. I'll get full caps for overnight storage in the fridge, but I really like these guys for daily use. They work well enough for me and possibly better for others.", "review_title": "The work as advertised - almost.", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

On the Fab Four website it says it won't fit the ZR2 package but it did. Although, it needed some custom work done to the spare tire lowering port for the plastic to fit. This bumper is really heavy duty and I know my back end is much more protected now. Plus it has the added steps as the stock ZR2 bumper doesn't have any because they would get sheared off when rock crawling but these are thick solid steel. Besides the extra work for the spare tire port the only other nitpick is the fact that it bulges out on the sides and it is flat which is a bad thing as far as aerodynamics are concerned. Although it is probably negligible it would have been nice to have had it angled even a little to improve air flow. Besides those two small complaints I like the bumper and I would recommend it if you want a good looking, protective, and functional bumper.

When you exit the vehicle and the headlights stay on for a period, the sound is noticeable. Almost sounds like the electric fans on the radiator are running. They run any time the lights are on. 2. The lights cause interference in the electrical system. This is noticeable in the backup camera display. Not a huge amount but noticeable.

Then tuck the sides down between the door and bottom trim. Exit vehicle through front without opening back doors. Try to leave them shut like this for a while.

The hubcaps came very well packaged. The hubcaps and wire rings were packed separate in box to save room. Assembly was very easy, just snap the wire ring inside the inner tabs of the hubcap and install as usual noting the air valve stem groove location. There is a distinct difference between the official hubcaps that came with my Cube and the replacements in this review. First the official ones have more depth to them for lack of a better word. From a distance they're very similar sans the Nissan logo but they fit and look just fine. I was considering removing the silver rings and putting the Nissan rings inside but the mounting center tabs for the logo are different. I figure I could rig something up but it's not really worth the effort. If you need just one replacement you should just get the whole set of 4 as it's just different enough that it would be noticable against the official ones.

Much better price for others I've seen. The regular LED is bright for night riding. Didn't see a big change with the high beam on. The halo is nice and bright at night. The intensity level can be adjusted, but I just leave it to the max. Doesn't seem to stand out as much during the day as I have seen on holos on trucks and jeeps. Haven't seen any other bikes yet with a halo in person. I did had a 5amp inline fuse from the accessory circuit to a manual switch on my handle bars, then down the the halo controller. That way I can just have the LED on and no halo. Installation was as simple or difficult as any other light for the Bobber. Just have to make sure it is lines up properly with the retention clips that the Bobber uses to secure a light in its housing.", "review_title": "Works on 2019 Indian Scout Bobber", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

My work trucks have always had full pipe racks. I would not expect this rack to compare with those as this is a segmented (2 piece) set up. I just needed something to carry the odd long piece of lumber or pipe and not have to pay $50 delivery prices for the privilege. The first thing I would recommend is to \"through drill\" and bolt the pieces together and not rely on the supplied set screws. The set screws will be the first thing to come loose and cause a problem. I will confess that I did build a 48\" extension x 18\" wide to the front rack. I did this to stabilize 20' lengths of PVC pipe. This was a custom welding job that took me some time. The problem I ran in to was the height of this rack. In the pictures on Amazon, it looks like the rack clears the shown F150 by about 5\" of clearance. On my F350, that number shrunk to about 2\" of clearance. So, just be aware of this. Hint: To stabilize these racks I added a black ratchet strap between the front and the back portions. This way the racks are supported fore and aft by each other. I was going to bolt a steel flat bar to the two ends, but decided the ratchet strap idea was quick and easy to remove.

He also explained the problem with the older version I had: the caps were causing the rust. In the newer version, apparently everything is stainless steel. It was really hard to get some of the old caps off (anti-theft did it's job pretty well) - not sure if it's worth the hassle. Though It's unfortunate I had to replace these, I'm really appreciative of the seller's support and hopeful these new ones hold up longer! Kudos to the seller for wanting to make things right in this situation. ORIGINAL REVIEW - July 2019: I was amazed how badly these rusted during the winter. They lasted a little over a year but didn't expect to replace them so soon. Also, the caps don't seem to stay on too well.

Although almost all of the car settings can be changed using the set-up application on the car's multi-function display. However, the reversing beeping was not one of them; this setting had to be changed by a Toyota dealership. I checked with several dealers in the area and they all wanted > $150 to turn off the beep. Astounding! People online pointed me towards the Carista OBD2 unit. They'd all had success with it, so I purchased it. I'm glad that I did. I plugged the Carista in, it connected right up to my iPhone. Inside of about five minutes I had changed the beep from a constant beeping to a single beep (when reverse is engaged). My sanity was saved! The price is right, the function perfect. I like products that work as advertised!

Then spray some more the day before you try to install this hitch, and clean the threads out with a small wire brush as well. I installed this on our 2008 MDX in about 90 minutes, but it would have been half that if the mounting holes had been clean. I honestly thought the bolts were the wrong size for a while because I could not get them started in any of the 8 holes, due to the rust. Finally after spraying a ton of Liquid Wrench and cleaning with a brush, I was able to get them started. I applied some copper anti-size, and still had to really torque on some of them to run them all the way down. Other than that, the install wasn't too bad. I lowered the spare tire, removed the 4 rubber exhaust hanger mounts so it could be lowered and moved side to side a bit, then remove the exhaust heat shield from one side. This left me just enough room to get the hitch in place. It fit pretty snug and the holes lined up. It didn't have to be forced into place or anything. One bolt on each side will most likely require a socket extension to access; the other 3 were pretty easy to get to. The finish hitch looked pretty good. We'll see how it holds up. The rust on my MDX obviously isn't the fault of the hitch manufacturer, but I deducted one star because the packaging was pretty bad. It was just thrown in a cardboard box with almost no padding. One of the mounting plates was actually sticking out of the box when it arrive. But there was no visible damage, so I wasn't too concerned.", "review_title": "Not too bad, other than the packaging.

The light beige interior was immaculate despite it's age, and with kids & dogs I wanted to ensure I did all I can to keep it that way! I'm pretty sure these will do a fantastic job for a very long time. They fit very well in the car and are not too difficult to move out of the way if you need to stow a seat. The one thing that I have found a bit annoying is that the very back edge of the mat does seem to get in the way of putting the rear seats back into seat position if you had them stowed. It slips back so the seat catch will not engage so you kind of have to fiddle with it a bit... It also seems to hinder the ability for the front center console to slide back. Small price to pay I suppose. I'm thinking I might try grabbing some velcro tape to put on the bottom in the hopes it will catch on the floor carpet and hold in place a little better. so the functionality of the car is not hindered.

The elastic straps and metal hooks also required some engineering, but they are holding very securely now and the seat covers look really great in the SUV. The seat covers, themselves, are nicely made and compliment the vehicle.", "review_title": "Very stylish seat covers.", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

Just randomly selected these. So far they look like they will work. My biggest issue was not having an installation instructions. I'm not a mechanic and can barely hammer a nail. I was hoping for a step by step process within the packaging but nothing came. So went outside and removed the old ones. On our 06 Town & Country you will need a T40 star thingy to remove old ones. Once removed I didn't know if there was a special way to put these one so I just screwed in the odd looking screw/ball to the van. Then popped in the supports.

I usually use public vacuum cleaners at car washes; this did a comparable if not better job than those, AND it has the added bonus of exchangeable nozzle pieces. (3) ACCESSIBILITY: The small nozzle piece is awesome, because in my experience even the smallest nozzles on home vacuum cleaners are too large to reach the crevices of your car. This one by far does the best job I've seen. (4) EMPTYING: I used this to vacuum the front seating area of my car and needed to empty it once in the middle of the job.

Motor is usually not the problem, it's the piece for sale here. Read other answers and reviews to install. Remove both back seats after separating them. Pop off the 4\" wide trim below the window. In order to remove the long section, you must remove the pulley from the end, then pull the thin cable through each side of the seat belt bracket. Pry the bracket forward some to get the cable through. You have to do the same procedure to install the new long cable. Pry open the pully piece to reseat the jacket part of the cable back inside the pulley. You need to work the driver side first. Push the new long cable back into the metal clips that hold it. With a twisting action, insert the pully into the end of the window rail. Slide cable towards the window, be sure to get it under the black plastic clip on the rail. Slide end ball of cable into the window. Now work the Pass. side. Insert the ball into the window first, then pop the pulley into the end of the frame. You'll have to pull hard to get the pulley past the end of the frame. Pop new clip to the right of the pulley. Insert the bottom of the drive pulley into the truck frame then (after removing the yellow retainer) insert the screw to tighten down the drive pulley. Reinstall all trim pieces and seats. Be careful not to break the anti-rattle pieces on the seat brackets. Lubricate the window rails so the window doesn't drag, which could cause the drive to fail again.

One thing that I think some people forget to do, is to make sure that the surface they are applying the product to is cool to the touch. I chose a small area of my vehicle to try this on, but one that need to be restored. I carefully applied the Cerakote Trim Coat to the bumper cover, being careful to only get it on the plastic and not on the paint. Applying small, short strokes of the wipe seemed to do the job. Immediately you could see the old dull area become shiny and dark black. Once I was done, and about 30 minutes after application, I took my after pictures. So far it seems like a great product, and I will look this evening to see if anything has changed. I plan to use this next on the inside of the vehicle to liven up some dull, worn out areas. I look forward to great results and a continued future using the Cerakote Ceramic Trim Coat Kit.", "review_title": "Cerakote - Seems Great......Time Will Tell", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

The material is durable and the lips around the edges allow them to collect dirt and debris. The only flaw I found was the texture on the trunk mat. I was hoping for something that had a little more friction. As is, my groceries slide all over the place on the slick surface. This would be a good thing if you have something heavy, say a big tent, cooler full of ice and drinks, and large luggage that you want to set on the edge and slide to the back of the vehicle. In that case, you don't want sticky friction making it more difficult. That is a rare case for me, as I am more likely to throw a cart full of groceries back there. That type of texture would have made it difficult to clean too, which I can appreciate. I like the texture on the rest of the floor mats where it makes sense. It is enough of a problem for me that I removed a star. I also removed a star because they are extremely expensive! I would have liked to see them more around $150 - $175. But I still bought them, and I do HOPE they last for the life of the vehicle, in which case, it is a worthy investment. If I have to replace them in 5 years, the cost would then be unreasonable. Overall, I highly recommend these floor mats to anyone looking to protect their 2016 RAV4 floors. They are very expensive and things in the trunk do slide around too much, but you won't find a better fit or better protection I think. 3/5 stars.

This is the best product I have ever used on my Corvette. I've had corvettes for 6 years now and no product has done to my car what this has. My car is SLIPPERY!!! SMOOTH!!!! LIKE NEVER BEFORE ITS AMAZING! I want to say SLIPPERY again because that's what it does! Do these steps. If your car is stupidly dirty and has been for a long time ***clay bar first*** 1. Start off by wax stripping your car with Meguiars wash+ as a normal car wash expect bucket only method . Do sections at a time (do not let that stuff dry on your car). Water it down and do sections at a time. Please understand that. 2. Use this sealant on your car. Easy on the entire car then buff off after it turns white. Read product directions. You can do it a second time (not necessary) but wait 30 minutes after you buffed first coat. Please wait 6 hours before adding anything else after this. 3. After 6 hours of curing the sealant on paint, use *Car Guys Hybrid Wax Spray*. I bought a gallon, well worth it. Spray your entire car with that while buffing off doing sections at a time. You can do 2 coats for a better result. This stuff will last you months!!! Sealant is once or twice a year. Hybrid spray wax is applied after every car wash. ***Make sure when you wash your car next time to not use wax stripper on it or you'll defeat everything you have done. The wax stripper is a tool used to prep for a new sealant or wax on the car*** Did you read that up there? 4. Also I like to use chemical guys maxi suds grape. Its concentrated and a gallon. Its $18. Buy 2 gallons it will last you 3 years! Use it right, do not exaggerate. *A cap can do 5 gallons of water* Use more If you want. Best car wash shampoo you'll ever use, better then their entire line up as well. 1 galling should last you a year or 2 depending on how you use it and how much. This product is a shampoo that leaves a small amount of wax and a coat of enhanced glossier on your car after every wash. Never wash your car with hard water after you put this stuff on your car or you'll just strip it of your cars surface. *************************************** Do all of this on your car and maintain it that way all the time. You will wish you can thank me. This is the perfect stuff to keep your car looking its vest you wont even want to drive it! Thanks Car Guys, you guys are something else.
