The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight.

For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you\u2019re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don\u2019t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn\u2019t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you\u2019re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it\u2019s pretty much plugged in most of the time.

With a new puppy I needed one asap. So I purchased this one. What a disappointment! The \"mesh\" net was thin and easily ripped by puppy claws. There were NO directions with how to place it. The wall mounts were weak and fell off after one day. I was so upset thinking that the other 2 were going to be the same way and couldn't imagine why this net was highly rated. WELL when the other 2 came they were of much better quality. The mesh net was strong and solid, the wall attachments were big and once I stuck them on the wall there was no getting them off! There was a nice 1 page explanation of how to place the wall attachments to assure the gate worked best. WHAT a difference! The puppy has pawed at it several times and has not ripped it nor has the pressure he placed on the mesh torn the wall attachments off the wall - BOTH of which happened with this cheap version.

You cannot get this seat tight, the latches are merely metal clips that bend too easy, and the base being flimsy only gets worse. My daughter sways in the back the whole time we drive. I\u2019m actually trading this seat in to be recycled and replacing with another Graco. No way in heck this would last long term or in an accident. Not worth the risk! I purchased this seat to compare to a graco 4 ever all in one for quality and also fit. I have a 2014 Chevrolet 1500 crew cab truck, so space is tight from the rear facing seat to the back of the front seat. After having these seats side by side, I have to say the graco is worth every penny. It\u2019s very solid in construction, no wobbling, quality fabrics. The plastics are quite a bit sturdier and not flimsy whatsoever. I don\u2019t have any doubt that the 4 ever seat will last 10 Years. The safety first is a good seat, it\u2019s just not on the level of the graco. The plastics are noticeably thinner, slight wobble, the fabrics are softer but don\u2019t keep their shape (it came with the headrest crumpled up) and are warmer than the graco, something important to keep in mind for our Texas weather. The base on the safety first is narrow and sways on hard floor or car seats no matter how tight the belt is. For being taller in height, I\u2019m surprised to find that the graco fits better in my truck. The safety first takes more room reclined, and has many less recline options. It\u2019s also wider than the graco. Had my daughter not spit up on the safety first as I was testing it, I would return it and get another graco. The difference in price is well worth the quality. When it comes to budget, I just don\u2019t think car safety is the pace to trim dollars. It\u2019s important to note that the graco can serve as a backless booster and handle 20 pounds more. I\u2019m hoping the safety first will last as a secondary seat, but for those shopping for a primary seat, please save your dollars and invest in the 4 ever. My vehicle and my husbands have quite a few safety features that not all vehicles may have, which is the only reason I\u2019m comfortable keeping this seat.", "review_title": "Updated- don\u2019t buy", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

I purchased this stroller to make the trip easier however after having used the stroller a week before traveling the wheel some how got cracked and caused it to wobble and not properly maneuver the stroller. I realized the cause for the maneuver issue at the airport, and I wish I had saved the money and just stuck with my jogger/stroller since it is a LOT more sturdy and that wouldn't have happened. I also did not realize the height of the handles being an issue until had had lengthy use for it, i am 5'6 and the handles are a bit short for me. Update: I got in touch with the seller and they reached out to the manufacture since they are not the ones to keep parts on hand. I received the new wheel and replaced the broken wheel, however it is still struggling to maneuver properly and it is really frustrating because I'm not sure what to do with it", "review_title": "broke in a week", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

I have the Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogger that was a gift, but it is way too big to use as an everyday stroller. After comparing, contrasting, and praying for weeks and weeks, I decided on this J is for Jeep double stroller. Price definitely played a part in my decision, as a mom of twins, when you have to buy two of everything, you want to make the most economical choice possible. My first impression was that it was very cheap looking and flimsy. It is described as burgundy, but it looked way more purple to me. I wasn't happy about this, but I let it go after many people told me it didn't look purple to them. It is lightweight, which I love. It also does not take up much space, an important factor for a mom of 3. But the wheels are plastic, which doesn't make for the most smooth ride. The middle tires twist while the side tires to straight, which makes it wobble from time to time. In addition, it is not the easiest to close. You should be able to use your foot to kick the lever to close the stroller, but many times I find myself in the middle of the parking lot stooped down and pressing the lever by hand just to get it to close. My biggest complaint of all is that the harness does not secure my boys, no matter how tight I pull the straps. They are always able to wiggle their arms out of the chest part of the harness, then they lean forward, which propels their whole body forward, allowing them to drag their feet on the ground. They are also able to lean over and touch the wheels at this point, and there has been an occasion where one of their fingers was smashed. I am returning this stroller and plan to purchase something with better quality wheels and harnesses, or possibly even a belly bar. I like the thought of a side by side stroller so that both of my boys are able to see what's going on, and they seem to take up less space, but I may have to go with the other type. This stroller was a disappointment. The only good thing is that I don't have to use it much because we don't go out a lot where I would need it.

I'm not sure if it would have tipped over because the rest of her was still inside and her legs were already fully extended, but it was enough of a wake-up call for me to put her on the floor. She was not tied down, but I doubt the safety belt would have kept her secured - even when I belted her in she pushed out of it. A 3- or 5-point harness system would definitely be an improvement.

The base is solid, and the swivel and adjustable height are nice features. It does seem to tilt slightly, which is to be expected given the support is not centered. It helps to place the baby with his/her head on the elevated side, over the support pole. The electronic accessory pad is essentially useless. The lights are blocked by the mesh, and if you use the infant insert, only a scant amount of light gets through. Also, if you use the electronics at all, be prepared to go through A LOT of batteries. The vibration feature is the most egregious offender. After two sets of batteries, which lasted maybe 10 hours total, I gave up. For the price, I would expect a better product that at least has a rechargeable battery or AC plugin. The buttons for the front rail drop-down are hard to access, and the feature overall is not very useful. This bassinet is an ok product, but arguably overpriced for what you get.

So I decided to give it a try. The first several times we used it on our sick 2 year old we noticed the snot coming back up the tube that goes in out mouth, and at least once, we each had it make it all the way without us noticing......YUK. I was about to give up on it all together and order something similar to the one we had when my wife suggested switching the tubes on the bulb, meaning, the tube that fits in the nostril leads to the top of the bulb and the tube that goes in our mouth leads the side. This simple change made the whole thing more like the one we did have and now directs the snot straight down into the bulb instead of toward the tube that leads to the mouth. With that change we have not had any problems with the snot getting into our mouths and we are both much happier with this device.

Also, the chest and waist harness straps come easily unthreaded with no pressure, which makes it very annoying to dig under the kids' bodies to buckle them in every time. Replacement straps keep having the same problem. Customer service, while not overtly rude or with attitude, is lacking. I waited over two weeks with no response to emails before I gave up and called. Customer service reps do not address all issues brought up and I have to repeat myself constantly. They do honor their warranty, but I'm disappointed that it takes so much effort and time on my end to get problems resolved.", "review_title": "Decent stroller, poor customer service", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

The bench seat is really nice for older children. Super large basket underneath Cons: Fairly long stroller, it does help to have the extra wheels to help with maneuvering. The wheels on the bag (attaches to the stand up board) is fairly load when strolling in sidewalks with cracks. It is very large folded up and you have to take the seats off (this makes it take up the entire truck area of our Ford Flex) Overall this is a great stroller for families with children that range in age.

This is also the perfect height for her to wash her hands. Note: the step stool is tall so I would always suggest toddler supervision when using (even when the toddler wants to do it herself). I extend my hand so she can use me to balance as she walks up and down since the steps are a bit steep.", "review_title": "Great for potty training and washing hands.", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

First off I absolutely love how soft and flexible this bib and the vibrant colors and the cute designs make it even better. I love how its not just one button that the neck can be looped through but there are 3 buttons in which I can loop it through in order to avoid my daughter from taking off the bib herself. Now on to why I was 1 star short of 5, this bib would be the perfect bib for going out because of how soft it is, it makes it very easy for me to put it away without having to fiddle for the necessary space for it to fit. However if you plan on using this bib with your highchair there may be a bit of a problem with the flexibility. In most cases for high chairs used at home there is a tray and depending on your high chair tray it may or may not blend the bib into a form where no food will be caught, which is exactly what happens to me. The bib folds inwards where the food cannot be caught and my daughter ends up having all the soup, food, crumbs, etc all over her legs. I don't need to worry about her getting cut from the bib but the softness of the bib causes problems where the bib is ultimately not catching anything that is falling. Given the material of the bib and how much I like it once I took it out of the box I had to give 4 stars. The pocketed bib is completely defeated in the case of the highchair tray but I'm sure when we are out and sitting in restaurant highchairs the bib will be differently seen. So keep in mind if you do end up getting this bib and you're planning on using this at home check you highchair tray first.", "review_title": "I have a love and hate relationship with this bib", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

This was one of the top bags I kept reading about. I exclusively pump for my baby and we started to travel quite a bit once he turned 6 months old. I was really stressed about how to take milk with me and how to take so much. I thought the bag would be a bit larger, but it ended up working out. We were away for 7 days for our first trip and I noticed by stuffing this bag with frozen breastmilk, it actually kept all my milk bags frozen. Only one bag (up top) had started to defrost, but was still slushy. The entire duration of the trip was 5-6 hours. I ended up ordering a second bag because I was not able to fit a week's worth of milk supply in the bag (baby was still drinking 6-7 feedings at this time). It wasn't too big of a problem. Due to traveling alone, I packed both bags into my suitcase right before leaving. On the trip back, I ended up taking it out and carrying it through TSA due to the weight it was adding to my suitcase (7 pounds)!! Our second trip was just a few days ago. I didn't take as much milk and I did notice more of the milk bags had started to defrost, but still frozen enough to put back in the freezer once I arrived at my destination. We will be traveling to Cabo in a couple of months. I am a little nervous since the flight will be longer than both of our previous trips, but I also do not have a choice and will need to make the best of the situation. I plan to take a lot of milk.

There were two reason I decided on the Britax Boulevard. 1. It was rated as one of the easiest car seats to install properly. 2. It has an ARB (Anti Rebound Bar) I've read articles that state that the number one cause of injuries to children in carseats is because the car seat is not installed properly. So #1 was extremely important to me. I have had limited experience with other brands, but I can say that the ClickTight helps get the car seat much tighter much easier than some other models. My only issue is that the base of the car seat is pretty wide and therefore can make it very difficult to reach the tether that is used when utilizing the anchors in the car. Some cars are easier than others, but that is probably the only time consuming part of installing and removing the seat. The strap on the tether is difficult to loosen which makes things harder. The only other negative i have to say is that you have to recline the seat before installing. That may be standard for all car seats, but I found that annoying considering how difficult the seat is to remove and loosen when already installed. That is the only reason i give it a .5 star below a 5. My son was very comfortable in this seat almost immediately... I saw a huge difference in his comfort when comparing to the infant only car seat.

This cuts way down on any bubbles that may appear. The product also makes for no mixing in the middle of the night.

You are using a lot of formula so it\u2019s important to count the scoops. It\u2019s easy to get distracted and then wonder how many scoops you\u2019ve used. Second you could never fill this to max.

This bag can hold a ton of stuff, and it has so many pockets! Many of the pockets have elastic around the top, to better hold things like bottles and sippy cups. The main compartment has pockets all the way around the inside, and the two small pockets on the outside on either end of the bag also have elastic that allows them to expand and hold the items in securely. . I easily fit everything that's in my current diaper bag, into this bag. Including: a full 100-count pack of wipes, a handful of disposable diapers, four cloth diapers, a travel-sized wet bag, a sippy cup, a couple of extra outfits, a few toys, the travel changing pad, an entire roll of flushable cloth diaper liners, two burp cloths, a 16-oz bottle of water and a handful of small toys. I put all of that in the main compartment, leaving the waterproof pocket (which I would probably use to put dirty cloth diapers in, while also using the travel wet bag), and the \u201cmommy pocket\u201d empty. I still had more than enough space to put things like my phone, wallet, etc. if I didn\u2019t want to carry a purse and a diaper bag. . The main compartment zips on three sides, but it has pieces of fabric that stop it from flapping completely open. This is handy when rummaging around for something, but you don't want your stuff to slide out. And it has two zippers, so you don\u2019t have to open it all the way if you don\u2019t need to. . Convertible. You can carry this cross-body or over one shoulder with the long strap, as a backpack, or just by the top handle. The long shoulder strap is plenty long enough. And it has small straps that can be used to attach it to the back of a stroller. . The included travel changing pad is a good size, and larger than it seems in the photos. It's as wide as the bag is. . It's a good size - about the size of a backpack or small messenger bag. . The little feet on the bottom that keep the bag itself off of the ground are a nice feature, so you don't have to worry about setting it in anything questionable, or if you have to set the bag down someplace that's bound to be dirty (like a public restroom floor, an asphalt driveway, the sidewalk, etc). . It's a nice-looking bag. The coloring is nice, and I like the pattern. It's hard to find a patterned diaper bag that men wouldn't mind carrying around, too. My husband doesn't have a problem with it, and said he\u2019d carry it. The gray fabric is nice, too. It has visual texture to it. It looks almost like gray denim. I like the fact that it isn't a solid color, which would show grime a lot more. Cons . The bag is heavy, even empty. That was my first thought when I took it out of the box. I thought maybe there was something left in it, but it was just the changing pad. I think it's all of the extra straps. You could take some of them off if you're not going to use them (all of them except for the handle on top are removable), but then what's the point of a convertible bag if you do that? . There's an imperfection in the pattern of the bag I received. It's not a big deal, but it bothers me now that I know it's there. . It's an odd shape for a backpack. It looks like a messenger bag, and I think it looks a little weird when worn as a backpack. But, again, not that big a deal. Wearing it as a backpack means it won\u2019t slide forward and get in the way when you bend over, like crossbody bags do. . There are a LOT of straps. This is bound to happen with a convertible bag, though, so there really is no stopping it if you want the versatility of a bag that can be worn many ways.

The stroller is incredibly simple to open and close. The only complaints i have are in regards to the cup holder and canopy. Whenever I open the stroller up, the cup holder insert always is undone. I have to reinsert it every time. Not a big deal. It\u2019s just a little annoying. As for the canopy, when the car seat is in the stroller, you are able to use both canopies (one from the car seat and one from the stroller) creating a little cocoon to block little one from the elements. When the stroller is stationary, this works great. However, if I\u2019m pushing the stroller, the canopy doesn\u2019t stay completely closed. It will slightly open. It\u2019s not too big of a deal unless you\u2019re caught in a torrential downpour while on a walk with a newborn. I had to quickly walk while holding the canopies together to ensure the newborn didn\u2019t get wet.

I\u2019m not sure if this is the best swing out there, but it\u2019s the only swing we have and boy does our baby love to swing. It\u2019s a great place for him to grab a nap if he\u2019s refusing to go down in the crib, and he also likes to relax there after a stressful session in the baby gym (only sort of joking). After reading other\u2019s reviews about the stars I thought \u2018who cares if they don\u2019t move??\u2019, but I now admit it would be great if they did. Those were the first things we caught him staring at and tracking, and he would be fascinated if they moved. But they\u2019re fine. The swing does move around more than we\u2019d like... we actually have to put a wash cloth under one side to stop it from wobbling. We\u2019ve tried it several different places and it wobbles everywhere, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s our floor. Also it is a little loud, but I actually think that provides white noise that lulls the baby to sleep, and it\u2019s not loud enough that we have to change the tv volume when it\u2019s on (for reference). His head does fall off to the side, but it does that in his bouncy chair too and doesn\u2019t seem to bother him. This swing is definitely not perfect, but it fits well in our living room and it chills our baby out, so it\u2019s a win for us!", "review_title": "Does the job!", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

Other teethers he would only use for a minute or so and get fussy or frustrated, but this teether can keep him occupied for awhile! Also sometimes if he's getting fussy while biting it, I'll take it and just gently brush his gums with the end and he loves it, sometimes he laughs haha.
