Both on par with what you would expect. There is a separate base station with it's own storage (via SD card), so no monthly fees to get your data off the cloud. The Bad: Pretty much everything else. The cameras have to be connected to the base station, not your WiFi network, so you can only get so far away from the base station. In my house there is just no way to cover both sides of the house with one base unit. Very frustrating because I already have a mesh WiFi system that covers the whole house and yard. The motion detection is astonishingly bad. It records dozens of little 6 second clips of nothing. I have tinkered with sensitivity, and pointing the camera slightly differently. Nothing works. There is no way to tell what motion is being detected -- most of the time I can't see anything moving. The front door cam is triggered by mystery movements, but ignores people coming to door more than half the time. The \"Activity zone\" feature (which to be fair is marked as beta) seems to have no effect at all. The system allows several different setup scenarios such as home, and away, disabled, etc. There is no way however to have them auto set based on location -- the obvious thing would be to allow my to set away automatically when I leave (or my phone does anyway :)) IFTTT integration would solve this problem, but alas non is provided.

The wifi repeaters that was sent to extend the signal of the cameras means that every camera has to be COMPLETELY uninstalled and taken down from the walls and roofs that they are mounted to, which means cutting the conduit tubing that is protecting the wires since they are outdoors. THEN bringing each camera inside to the nvr and programming each one once connected to the nvr. Then after all that HOPEFULLY it all WORKS! (<--probably won't) Then at that point we can go back and completely install each camera like we had originally mounted them. So that means all new screws, new tubing, more time and definitely MORE MONEY wasted!!! Had I known this I promise I never would have bought these. Another problem is that even with a couple of the units that are close enough to have a FULL signal record in odd increments! The playback of the video shows there's motion but then completely SKIPS and JUMPS through all that motion so you can never even see what actually triggered that motion to begin with. I have it setting to record all cameras 24/7 plus I have motion to record in the 'continue setting' but like I say they jump allover the place. HORRIBLE. I can only assume the people that state they love this system and that are \"Verified Purchases\" must have some tiny houses cause they don't have these issues. And must have extensive networking experience cause I still can't even get these to port-forward through my router correctly to view them from our mobile devices when we are not at home. ---------------------------------------- I purchased the 8 camera 1080p wireless system with 2TB drive already installed and at first had a few problems with these cameras maintaining connection. By contacting customer service we discovered the house and distance between the cameras and the NVR was simply too large and far between. Grace with their great customer service team advised that even a longer antenna would not suffice so instead she acquired approval to have them send a wifi repeater or extender system that will essentially make up for the distances. I hope once that is all set up, installed, and programmed that it should all be working great then.", "review_title": "The security system is not worth it's price.", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}

We bought this because the range on our handheld monitor just wasn't far enough to reach the backyard and the battery life was short so we had to bring the plug everywhere. We figured we'd get a camera we could monitor from our phones. This has AMAZING picture quality and I can clearly zoom in and see the baby breathing. However, you can't just leave the sound on all the time so you'd know if baby was crying at night and hear them. You have to physically open the app, make sure the sound is on and then you'd know if they're crying. That's a HUGE flaw for me... I'd prefer it continually run in the background so you can hear sound (don't need the picture all the time, just the sound)... I suppose you could possibly leave your phone on all night long and leave it on for sound but I'm sure that's not good for your phone...", "review_title": "Not great for a baby monitor...

They cast this ugly white light on everything unless you buy an expensive Diffuser Set. My main problem was the mounting bar which i got with this kit seems to be a cheap knock off. I could not get one of the cubes on it because one screw mount is not all the way threaded. Once i screw the cube down all the way onto it, the cube is facing off to the left (no good). If i loosen it, then the cube just spins around and is useless, this screw mount isn't threaded enough to put the choke collar on to hold it still. The other mounting prong is situated too close to the camera mounting screw so that you can't adjust the cubes position at all. In the instructional videos i watched on how to mount the cubes to the arm, the arm i got with this kit didn't even look like this! Now my GoPro mounting buckle is stuck to this cheap mounting arm and i can't get it off!

Having just moved into a newly remodeled home, the last thing my wife and I wanted to do was poke holes in the walls for our art collection.

So far I've had 4 frames fall off the wall all by themselves. The first one happened in the middle of the night, what a scary wake up moment that was. All four were damaged and needed to be replaced, including a frame and print that I've had for over ten years which was torn when the frame broke upon hitting the wood flooring. Another fell behind the desk it was hung over and damaged both the frame and the desk. For what it's worth, my home is climate controlled and in most cases these frames fell off the walls when no-one was home. We have no children and no pets, don't smoke or throw wild parties. The drywall and paint these are hanging from were clean and new when I hung everything up. I'm pretty confident that I didn't do anything wrong while installing. Instead I think the strips simply dried up and let go. I gave two stars in this review only because 11 out of the 15 frames are still hanging.

This, in turn, will cause the entire adapter to rock when placed against a flat surface; and 2) it lacks a flat top surface to mate with the underside of a camera. Instead, the camera bottom is in contact with the thin edges of the top of the dovetail bar. This will stress the camera too much for my tastes.

The big flaw here is how your GoPro (etc) mounts. It mounts just fine but you can't properly fit the thumb screw in place. The more you tighten it, the hard it is to tighten because it hits the frame of the light. I can't believe they were able to even sell this the way it is, it's that bad. That said, without enough work (and a screw driver) you can tighten it down but make sure the housing for your GoPro will stay with this light permanently because having to unscrew and re-screw it would be a huge pain. Dedicate a GoPro case/holder/frame/housing (whatever it's called) just to this and it becomes better. The other issue is that the battery doesn't last long. A few hours probably but that's not long. The charger blinks orange and green while charging so you'd think it would turn green when done, right? Nope, blinks orange and green forever regardless. So you just have to charge it for hours or overnight and assume it's fully charged, and hope it is. The light itself is amazing.

I found that I could better maximize space by packing the camera with the lens off.

The second time out, i noticed the eye cup on the right side was not twisting up and down as smooth as the left. I thought for sure there was some particles in there so i blew them out with air can that i use on my keyboard at home. Nothing was impeding the cup from twisting. I twisted both cups back down and placed the cap on them to store in my scent away bag. The next day i opened bag, put my bino harness on and head out to my spot. When i got settled in, I took the cap off and with the cap, the eye cup fell to the ground!! I noticed that there's like three tiny screws (plunger screws?) missing. How does this happen? i wrote to Celestron literally 5 minutes ago and pending their reply since Amazon said they cannot cover this issue and deferred me to the manufacturer. I should've just spent the extra money and bought a name brand Vortex or Nikon. I'll repost when i hear back from Celestron.

So now I can't even view all of my locations on the same app. The App works great if I am on the same wifi network as the cameras BUT struggles significantly when I am away which is not a issue with my other Amcrest systems or previous App (so what's the point of the new app if its unusable).

However this is really only your basic entry level drawing tablet and for what you pay its not too bad. A bit disappointed to find the drawing surface already had scratches on it which begs the question if this had been opened before. However the tablet still works in the scratched area. Was surprised to discover you get 2 pens. One pen is a rechargeable pen, the other is a pen in which you can put a AA battery in. The battery pen would be alright as a back-up if the rechargeable one suddenly dies mid work, however this pen is very heavy with the battery inside and feels rather uncomfortable in comparison to the rechargeable pen which is extremely light and almost feels like a normal pen in your hands. As for packaging, I was a little amazed at the condition the box arrived in and almost refused to sign for it based on what I could see.

The first issue which I could have lived with was the small screw that connects the stand with the NVR/screen broke off when I was screwing it in, so the stand was no longer secured. Still functional and the screen would still sit up/rest on the stand but it was not secured by the screw. Since the screw broke off I could no longer remove the broken piece of the screw. The screw was very thin and it seemed to be made of very cheap metal, almost like a hard plastic. Very minor issue but a little annoying. Thankfully I hooked up the cameras before actually wiring through the attic because 2 of the longer wires did not function. I made sure they were plugged in properly but would get no signal. The cameras were not the issue because I switched the cameras that were not producing a picture onto wires with cameras that were producing a picture and was able to get a picture. I then switched the picture producing combos onto the NVR/screen ports that were not producing a picture with the faulty wires and was able to get a picture, so ports were not the issue either. After examining the faulty wires I did notice that the zip ties I had removed had possibly damaged the wires. They have been tied so tight that it removed the coating on the wires and I could see the wiring under the coat. I'm not sure if this was the issue but did notice it on both wires that did not work. With that said I was pleased with the quality of the picture. The NVR/screen seemed very nice as did the cameras. I contacted amazon and told the rep I was willing to keep the system as long as they could replace the 2 faulty wires. I was told since this was sold through amazon, but not by amazon they could not do that and I would have to send back the whole system. I did. I wasted a few hours and had to deal with the hassle of sending the whole thing back, now waiting for my refund before I decide if I want to give this system a 2nd shot. If not for the wires I think I would have been very happy with this system but its hard to say as I did not get to fully set it up and test it. I have to question the quality based on the cheap screw and delicate wires, though the rest (and honestly most important parts: cameras and NVR) did seem to be good quality, looked good and produced a good picture.

We already had a more traditional baby monitor but the layout of our new house made it important to be able to use the monitor when outside of RF (radio) range. For example, I wanted to be able to go mow the lawn while the baby was napping, or walk across the street to the neighbor's house after bed time, and have my phone alert me if the baby woke up. At its core, this product works great - but it has a fatal flaw that is specific to the Arlo iOS app. This also affects Arlo's home security camera products. The big problem (and it's a big one) is the notification method on the app: When there is an alert sent to the app (baby crying, robber trying to steal your car, etc.), the alert tone is not configurable and can only use the default message tone (usually a quiet \"chime\"). There is no way to select a loud/annoying alert tone, override the phone volume, activate the vibration, etc. In practice this means you will not hear the tone if you're sleeping, or even if your phone is in your pocket - unless you set the tone to something else and always keep the volume on. Which means you'll get the same tone when you get a Facebook message, or any other app notification. Many similar iOS apps allow you to choose a custom alert tone (say a loud \"siren\" sound), configure the vibration settings (so you can \"feel\" the alert in your pocket), override the phone's volume settings (say you turned the ringer switch off and forgot), and otherwise allow you to make the alert sufficiently loud to get your attention. So this is not an Apple problem, this is 100% a NetGear problem. And it is a huge problem. If a thief is breaking into your car at 3 AM, the Arlo cameras will detect it and send a single, quiet, almost-inaudible \"chime\" to your phone, which will not wake you up and you will never know until it's too late. This is a major problem for a security system. Users have been requesting this be fixed for almost 5 years and NetGear has not added this relatively simple feature. As a bonus annoyance, it's available on the Android version of the Arlo app, so they obviously know it's important - they just can't be bothered to implement it on iOS. Or perhaps they fired their good iOS developers, or maybe they simply don't care about iPhone users. Whatever the reason, it is a major MAJOR shortcoming for a security product that renders the whole thing almost useless in practice - and despite hundreds of complaints they don't seem interested in fixing it. There are a couple other minor annoyances in the app design but overall this is a solid and well-designed product that is effectively crippled by a simple problem they refuse to fix (but only for Apple users). So if you're an iPhone user, I strongly recommend doing your research before choosing a product. I hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake I made.", "review_title": "Important notes for iPhone/iOS users", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}

The clips that you attach the lenses to don't stay in place at all even though they seem fairly tight, any bit of force (or weight from the big lens) will make them move enough and defeat the purpose and have to reset everything. Also, upon inserting one of the lenses into the clip. it didn't thread in correctly and cross-threaded so bad it wont even work anymore because the threads are plastic all around and very weak. The best part of it that I enjoyed is the wireless clicker. Setup is very easy and it works like a charm. I will definitely be using it for future photos and videos along with the little tripod. The tripod grips the phone very well so it wont go anywhere and the legs have good grip for various surfaces. If your looking for a camera lens kit with good lens quality, don't go with this.

Included I added a picture of a quarter next to the spy cam for size. the camera works great! It came with an SD card. the instruction manual showed how to format the card. and with a simple few clicks i was able to record video. It records video in 5 minute increments. the quality is decent. I cant say it looks 1080P but very close it it. the detail is present. which is what is needed. the battery lasts up to an hour with recording. the night vision works really well too! it automatically detected the darker environment and switched over to night mode. the app it comes with works great. it was a bit of a hassle getting it connected to the wifi but it eventually worked. you can watch the camera live. but the video seems a bit delayed. other then that I haven't given it enough time to see how to get audio recorded. The Instruction manual is a bit confusing but eventually I figured out the camera. The Video recorded looks good. it came with a handy magnetic mount that works well. The only cons I found, the first is the cost. it's a bit pricy! but it works good. the second is it came with a USB cable to charge it, however it didn't come with a USB Brick to plug into the wall.

I'd give it five stars if I was not counting on this for all weather usage. I set this up by my deer feeder in the Fall. Once the weather turned rainy and temperature swings started getting bigger, condensation became a major issue. With a couple of dry and warm days, the camera works like a charm. If it's wet and cold, the pictures are useless due to lens condensation. Night images are really clear, when it takes night images. I haven't figured out if the night vision is a function of the battery percentage or if it's just finicky. Sometimes it works great. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. If you want to leave this on your deer feeder for a season, I'd look elsewhere. If you want to set this up and take it down regularly, especially when the weather is going to be nasty, it will work just fine. UPDATE: After posting the less than stellar review above, I've been back and forth with the manufacturer and they're going to make it right by refunding the purchase price. Pretty stand-up move considering the camera has been in use outside for four months now. Maybe I received a lemon.

It's either a sports camera (as the seller describes it) or potentially a spy camera (it's design makes it less than discreet but people may not be sure what it is). The camera is very well made and it feels like it was designed to survive being dropped and to take a fair amount of abuse. It's also waterproof out of the box which factors into its airtight seal design. There are individual buttons for the camera's various functions to make its operation as simple as possible. Want to take video? Press the video button. Connect to WiFi? Press the LAN button. Want to take a quick picture? Press the photo button. Because the camera does not have a screen any adjustments to the camera's settings must be done using the app. Screen resolution (max 1080p at 30 fps), frequency, exposure, motion detection and a number of other functions are all adjustable. The back of the camera is magnetic so you can attach it to virtually any metal surface. While you can stick to the side of your home appliances, a fire hydrant, etc. I would avoid attaching it to a moving car since it would probably pop off if you hit a pot hole. The camera comes packed with a bunch of useful GoPro compatible mounting accessories as well as a wrist band to wear it like a watch. It makes for a very bulky wrist accessory but if you want the camera readily available without having to dig it out of a bag when you need it kind of makes sense. How is the video quality? It's actually very good and comparable to the $29 Polaroid Cube. With the ability to adjust a number of the default settings image quality can improve quite a bit.

Small downsides: 1- Not being able to manage the photo content from the app (to delete, etc you have to do it directly on the frame, which is unfortunate if you're managing multiple frames, or tenor frames, like grandparents, this makes it much more challenging to accomplish updating). 2- it doesn't play gifs or live photos. 3- when videos come up, the play bar, volume bar, and edit button all pop up, changing the look of the display, and jolting you away from the smooth transition/viewing experience.

Pros: it works well; I can see my kids while they sleep; the monitor let's me know when it needs to charge; I like that there is a music button, with the VOX setting, the screen turns off when kids are quiet which preserves battery life; it gives us the option to mount to the wall with 2 holes on the back; it does not connect to WiFi which prevents hackers, so keeps my kids safe; it has volume controls and I can talk to my kids through the monitor which is great when I see them doing something they should not; the monitor for my kids room can twist different ways which is great when mounting. Cons: the screen is small; picture quality is not so great; because of the piece that stands the parent up and the charging cable, it can be awkward to stand up; the volume is not very loud; even though it's given the option to mount, no screws come with it to mount; the speaker control is not great and sometimes my kids can't hear me through it; it only sometimes beeps when the kids monitor gets unplugged. I've given it a 4 because for the most part it does it's job and it's good for what I need it for and that is to be a second monitor to the one of a different brand that I already have.

I also had to install a new video viewer to view the footage externally regardless of the video type chosen for export. Other than that. Great camera set up for the cost.

On one shoot I needed a battery powered light that I could move quickly. No cord, no hot light. Just handy. I've also used it for fill a couple of times, so being dimmable has been helpful. The cord, when used, is a bit short, so you have to rig the power adapter to the stand if you are raising the light. I wasn't expecting anything heavily armored, so the build quality is fine for my use. Light output is fine for its size. For me it's a good little light and the price is right.

I've used it around one week and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. High quality video, very easy and convenient use. Very good design.

When I turned it on, the camera name showed up in my Wi-Fi list and on a click I was connected to the camera.

It's completely able to be charging while it's in use so set on motion detection settings around our valuables when we're not there will be perfect for what we need. I took a pic above to show, you will not believe it when you buy it that such great quality pictures come from this tiny little camera.

This camera has what looks like an enhanced antenna and it does a good job at getting reception where I wasn\u2019t so sure it would. One thing I likes about this camera right away is that this camera has a rubber/silicone cap that you can remove underneath the body in order to access the microSD card. That\u2019s huge, because other cameras require disassembly. Image It\u2019s not the best out there, but I think it\u2019s just fine for what it is, and even when zooming in digitally, I can see an acceptable level of detail. I also think the night vision is pretty clear, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to capture some video or images during a lightning storm, you\u2019re in for a treat. Obviously, when using the IR feature, you can see red LEDs in the dark on the front of the camera. Installation Mounting it is pretty effortless because there are two axes on which you can adjust the camera. There is no way to adjust it via the software, so depending on your installation; you may end up with a slight tilt. Still, the hardest part for me was getting power to the installation location. The camera has three cables coming out of it. One is a reset button, and the other two are power and Ethernet. It\u2019s just a shame that it doesn\u2019t have the ability to do PoE (Power over Ethernet) because that would make the installation much simpler. In either case, I ran power to a new outlet in the attic and then just used the included wall-wart to power it, and then connected it via WiFi. Operation The phone app (Android) is super easy to operate and it does a great job connecting to the camera no matter how strong my data signal is on my phone. It often connects when my Wyze cameras do not. There is the nagging issue of your data and information being transmitted to a server somewhere in China though. Somewhere I read a write-up on how to avoid that if you feel so inclined and have the technical know-how. The desktop software is much less refined and can be challenging to understand. However, it is very robust in that is has just about every option you can imagine and this is where you would setup your own DDNS address or your own server. I also set it up to automatically upload images to an FTP server, but I\u2019ve now reverted to just getting a notification during certain hours. For the price it\u2019s a good camera to have and play around with. I feel like I haven\u2019t yet figured out everything it can do, and perhaps with future software updates I\u2019ll discover more features.", "review_title": "Lots of option on software", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}

I figured all I needed was basically one who has a remote and I\u2019m good. Well reading about the capabilities of the action cameras I came across this one. Though more expensive than some models (but waaay cheaper than a GoPro) I splurged. It has the remote I wanted, but also works in low light, has a damper for the picture and 2 batteries. Another thing I like is I can connect to my phone and see what I am actually filming. I think I got a great buy. The camera comes with some attachments (none to attach it to an airplane strut.

Many people look at size or white balance and think that they are all the same. This is not true. You are going to want a ring light like this that has an internal white balance control. Some of the other brands use hard clip on covers to change the color but that is very time consuming especially if you use this for your business. With one button click in- you control the brightness and then the white balance- this helps get very natural looking pictures even in very dark corners. We are using this in a salon and the clients love getting their picture taken with it. If you are using this for your own vlogs or pictures- spend the extra and get the remote.

The first thing I did after connecting it to power and my network was to log in via the IP address and update new firmware, which it automatically detected from the cloud. It automatically picked up an IP address on my subnet so I didn't have to go looking for it other than to find it in my router's list of connected devices. The update installation took a few minutes and it was just long enough that someone impatient might try to restart it or interrupt the process-- you should never interrupt a firmware update while it is in progress; just let it finish on its own. I found the included software to be not the most intuitive software to use, but that didn't really affect me because the camera is very easy to configure through Internet Explorer using it's IP address. It was also very easy to connect to the free iSpy software I use to monitor my other cameras, and it claims to work well with several other common video software suites though I haven't tried the others. I tested this camera in several different places around the exterior of the house and the interior and found the image quality at night and day to be very clear.

It isn't nearly rigid enough. I wanted to look above my ceiling to trace the electrical wiring, but I couldn't snake this thing more than about four feet before it started to bend and bunch up. Trying to negotiate it through any sort of rough terrain is maddening when you can't see well and you have no control over the tip. All you can do is push on that rope. Why have a 10 meter scope if you can't use more than four feet of it? You might be able to run it down some kind of conduit or pipe or reinforce the cable with wire to stiffen it, but I don't feel like that should be necessary. 2) Thinking maybe I was using this for the wrong purpose, I tried running it down a drain pipe. I couldn't negotiate the P trap and the camera got covered with gunk so quickly that it wouldn't have mattered if I could. I think the best use for this is to look under your refrigerator or maybe in your gutter downspout. 3) The camera needs some kind of self-leveling mechanism. It's impossible to keep the cable from rotating as you try to maneuver it. You can tell the app to rotate the image 90 degrees at a time, but you can't tell the scope to stay right side up. You're constantly trying to figure out which way is up and what you're looking at. 4) When you add attachments, they block the view of the camera. It's like walking around using only your peripheral vision. It works, but not well. With much effort I successfully retrieved my keys using the magnet and the hook when they were on the floor right in front of me, so there's some theoretical value there. The mirror attachment is simply unusable -- I already said it was hard to use, once you can't see what's in front of you it's impossible. 5) The \"magic claw\" isn't attached to the device at all. It's a completely separate tool, and not very good. Search Amazon for \"flexible grabber\" and you'll see what it is, except it's only 2 feet long including the handle. Worthless. 6) You have to disconnect from your normal WiFi network in order to connect to this device. Not a deal killer, but inconvenient. There are a few things I liked about this device: 1) It's fairly inexpensive 2) The camera is decent 3) The light is good unless it gets covered in gunk 4) I found it fairly easy to connect", "review_title": "Disappointing", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}
