They took a little extra time to pair to my Pixel XL but overall pairing wasn't that bad. Charged them overnight to ensure they had a full charge.

I kept fiddling with settings on my phone trying to increase the volume and sound quality to no avail. As a last resort I switched to the large earbuds - what a difference! Once a true fit is found the sound quality is actually very good. The music never stopped or skipped over 8 hours while I did my yard work and they had approximately 40% charge left. I charged them overnight again then used them for a 2.5 mile walk. There were a few skips but I thought it might have been my stream. Then I used them for a 5 mile walk...they were dropping out every 20 mins or so and they earbuds seemed to lose pair with each other. First the right ear would drop, it would come back and immediately the left would drop for a second before reconnecting. The problem only got worse as I continued to use them. The last time I used them, I had them on for 2 hours and they skipped over 2 dozen times while the unpairing from right to left earbud happened at least 13 times.

The stem (which holds the phone grip to the base) came out and won\u2019t reattach. The adhesive on the base appears to be good only for one application. This product is really good (fantastic even, for Android users - more on that later.) It has two mounting options out of the box: Dash mount and vent mount. The dash mount option is surprisingly excellent - it comes with a really sticky adhesive that really does grip most dash materials, making for a great alternative to hogging an A/C vent in warmer climates. The clamping solution is great: Its electronic, and thus, automatically opens when your vehicle provides power or when you touch the bottom of the device. It automatically closes when your phone is placed against the back plate, touching the aforementioned bottom piece from within. My only \"complaint\" is that the device doesn't automatically open when power is cut to the mount. When I pull the key out of the ignition, power is cut to the mount, leaving me to have to \"extract\" my phone by \"pushing/sliding\" it up and out of the clamp surface.

I use this on my TV to connect to a bluetooth speaker. The distance between the TV/havit and the speaker is less than 15 feet. Most days it works great. Some days the sound skips. I do love that there is absolutely NO delay so the sound and picture are always in sync. I do NOT love the fact that I have to reconnect my TV/havit to the speaker every time I turn the devices on. I use the bluetooth speaker instead of the speakers on my TV because the TV speakers are BEHIND the TV so it makes hearing what's on nearly impossible unless the volume is up all the way.

If you are looking for a cord to use with an older tv model, try looking somewhere else.", "review_title": "Very Unhappy With Quality", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

The product description indicates that there is a gradient of 20 different light settings that the device goes through to gently wake you. It does not. It has 3 light settings - dim, bright and super bright. The first setting goes on 30 minutes prior to the alarm clock set time. It then hard transitions to the next brightest setting 15 minutes later and then to the brightest setting at the alarm time, which is also when the alarm sound starts up. That being said, that's how the product functions when the alarm actually works. Unfortunately, the alarm function doesn't always work, even when the alarm is set. My other issue with this alarm clock is the sound quality is bad. The \"white noise\" and alarm clock sounds are short loop tracks and sound very tinny. Also, even though there are volume up/down buttons that you can use when setting the alarm, the sounds always come on at the loudest setting when the alarm goes off.

This Polk bar offered similar features to the Vizio one we bought, but also includes a built-in Alexa. 300$ was a bit much for a soundbar but the Alexa made us think it would be worth the price. We were wrong. The first thing we noticed was the bar was noticeably thicker and longer than our Vizio, and we had to move our TV around to fit it on the stand. Also the subwoofer was awkwardly cone-shaped and felt like cheap plastic. The box contains generously both an HDMI cord and an optical audio cord, which is nice. We connected the bar and followed the instructions for the initial setup. Turns out you need to download a mobile app to setup the Polk, separate to the standard Alexa app we already used. After downloading the app, we of course now need to create a Polk account to sign in. I reluctantly performed all this hoping it was just for a first time setup, but unfortunately I could not find a way to use the Polk Alexa from the Alexa app. The Polk app itself is fairly barren compared to the Alexa app. We completed the setup, and the TV finds the soundbar pretty quickly through the CEC, which is great. But then we notice just how LOUD Alexa is, much louder than the show we were testing the volume with. The Alexa voice does NOT have a separate volume control anywhere, and will always be louder than the TV output. So if we are sitting at the ideal volume for our show, and then ask Alexa to turn off the lights, she will SHOUT back at us. This is a feature that the Polk app desperately needed. One of the features we tested with the Polk Alexa was to have it play Spotify, which it did like we wanted. But when we told it to stop, it would not automatically resume playing TV sound. After fumbling with voice commands for 5-10 minutes, we had to use the remote to force it back to TV HDMI input. We dug through the rather small manual trying to find the appropriate voice command, only to eventually find it on the Polk app of all places, hidden under some menus. The phrase was something like \"Alexa, set input to TV\" and if you said anything less than exactly that phrase, Alexa would refuse. Normally Alexa allows for some flexibility in the way you issue commands, so this was frustrating to remember exactly how to phrase it. Regarding the sound quality itself, we were extremely disappointed. So disappointed that we decided to stay with our dying Vizio for a while longer than suffer using the Polk. Our bedroom is probably considered medium-sized, comfortable but not huge. At first I said to my wife \"The sound doesn't seem much different than the TV speakers\", which I soon discovered was because the TV speakers were overpowering the sound bar. I turned off the TV speakers so I could judge the bar by itself, and was shocked at how poor the quality was. I could not clearly hear sound from the Polk soundbar from greater than 7 or 8 feet away, and increasing the volume certainly made it louder but not clearer. After spending the better half of my day trying to convince myself to accept the Polk, we decided to cut our losses and go back to the Vizio.", "review_title": "Refunded it", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

Rant over now also the chat audio mixer does not work very well the ps4 headset the 100$ one from walmart has a better one. The volume is also not very controllable once again the ps4 headset had better volume control. The wheel is very loose as well so i roll it on accident all the time. The surround sound however is very good if you can get over the things I disliked about it. But i feel there are other choices out there that i can get more out of for the same price. Like i said the 100$ ps4 ones were better in every way except sound. For 300 i should have very few dislikes.

HISTORY: I listen to my iPhone a lot in my car. This was no problem with my iPhone 6 and my 3.5mm cord. When Apple decided to remove the headphone jack from their phones, I had no way to play my music in my car. Enter, AUKEY. I purchased an older model in the summer of 2017. It worked really well: press/hold to turn on, press/hold to turn off. Very often, I listen to videos on Youtube which conveniently has a speaker option so I can verbally say what I want to hear and it will pull it up. One year later, my old AUKEY was dead. I bought THIS model - an upgraded model. It seemed to be the same (albeit rectangular instead of square) and used bluetooth. It connected right away. It turns on with no problem and I can play my phone's music through my car speakers. HOWEVER. Using the AUKEY prevents the speaker function in Youtube from working, entirely. Without the connection established, it works every time with zero problem. With AUKEY turned on, it simply breaks this function of the app. I have no idea why that happens. Second, when you try to turn the AUKEY device off, IT LAUNCHES SIRI. You can't turn it off! I've tested this at least 20 times over multiple days and each and every time, it pulls Siri up on your phone. You have to disconnect Bluetooth from your phone to turn off the AUKEY device. I went from someone who pressed one button and spoke outloud once in a great while to someone who constantly has to fiddle with her phone. I'm shocked it breaks a function of an app and concerned it's launching Siri and not turning off without significant interaction. I never had this problem with the old model - my biggest problem there was it only lasted one year. This one is possessed by some anti-youtube ghost who refuses to let the device shut off. It's sad, because I can't use it for the reason I bought it.", "review_title": "Possessed Device", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

When we called customer support it was found that it was the arm weight, there was not enough pressure pushing on the vinyl record causing it to skip. I was advised that I could buy another part (why would I do that when I literally just took it out of the box), or I could return the item. When I contacted Amazon about an exchange I was told it would be no problem, now the product is $30 more. I simply wanted to exchange the item for what I paid for it for a working model.

As soon as I received the product, I plugged in my Acer switch 5 on the usb-c port, and charged really fast. That was great...

Third step was to add another phone on the USB-A smart port, which I did, and to my surprise the tablet stopped charging...I unplugged the usb-a the tablet started charging again...bottom line the USB-a ports can NOT be used with the usb-c charging port... Bottom line, if you want to buy this charger keep in mind you can only use 2 ports, or the 3 USB-A ports... Buying this for the usb-a ports is not worth the money, buying this for the usb-c and quick charge port, I guess its a good deal, hence the two stars... It also comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable which is great, others in this price and even higher, dont.

Specifically it says this \" Use it to charge a USB-C and 4 USB-powered devices simultaneously at home or in the office.\".

The top piece and the bottom piece are meant to be screwed together but ot was so hard to get in there to drill a new hole out I had to so it by hand. There's not much space to move and get a grip so the screws ended up going in as much as they could but the two pieces are still relatively loose. There's a gap between the two pieces.

The worst by far is that while plugged in, either thru USB or AC adapter and playing music the speaker emits an electronic noise.

If you have a blip in power/internet this thing has to be hard reset, it isn't able to reconnect or attempt to reconnect, so it just makes an annoying chiming sound instead. Then you have to unplug it and replug it in. Somehow it cripples my Echo Dot. Whenever connected either directly with a 3.5mm jack or over the network, it disables the speaker no matter what I have the audio set to. This is advertised as an Alexa/Echo compatible speaker. It isn't . Lastly is that it has no battery.

I\u2019ve also hung it over my bathroom towel rack, when needed, because my bathroom never has enough outlets. It really needs to have a spring loaded lever that is as wide as the unit itself. Currently the lever is about a half inch, which means it doesn\u2019t touch anything I own other than my bookshelf, and therefore will not attach in a stable manner. (My counters aren\u2019t wide enough to even touch the lever and my antique desks are too deep to slide it onto). The lever spring is very strong, however, but because it is so thin, the power strip moves position every time you touch it! Possibly having a wider lever and some flat wings with rubber grips on each side, of the top portion of the strip, would prevent this, at least some. The USB and C ports work perfectly and quicker than I expected them to. The LED indicator light on top is so dim, that I have a terrible time telling whether or not the strip is on! The only time I can visualize it is when it\u2019s dark. And there is no labeling that tellers you which is which, either. At least not that I\u2019ve seen (I\u2019m visually impaired so this may just be me). Having so many places to plug in power cords and USB devices is extremely convenient and I love the concept! I love that the strip is at waist height and my cords are not all over the floor. If this design is improved, I\u2019d eventually buy several more. Until then, however, it gets one of my lowest ratings. The seller doesn\u2019t contact you back, the way they promise to, even after sending a direct email to my inbox, requesting that I contact them if dissatisfied. This is extremely frustrating. I\u2019ll eventually rig the lever so that it covers more surface area and holds onto more items, but have yet to have the time. I hope that the developers/shippers, whichever, can look into this, and design this item with either a wider lever or other attachment options so that it can be more useful in more places and prevent it from moving with every touch.", "review_title": "Great, BUT...", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

While not completely wrong as it does shut off accessories, it led me to believe that when switched off this would not draw power. I only wanted this so that I could leave a wireless fast charger mount plugged in with a switch to prevent power drain, but as far as I know this will drain as much or more power while switched off as the fast charger LED.

When I read the directions, it says that the wake to radio volume setting can't be turned down, because they do not want you to inadvertently set it to no sound at all (and thus not wake you up). I appreciate the need for a minimum sound setting, but it should be one third of what it is now. You must turn off the radio once it wakes you up, because no one would ever want it this loud.

So if you're looking for clear phone calls where you don't have to raise your voice for people to understand you, look elsewhere. However, hearing other people is no problem. Listening to music is wonderful. If you wear these without active sound playing, you can hear a slight hiss if everything around you is quiet, but it's not really an issue in my opinion. If you're active, they will need constant adjustment. You'll feel then loosening as you move. I luckily caught one of the buds before it fell out of my ear once. I use the medium size earpieces, and tried the large size, which were painful after a while.

The downfall is that the on earphone controls give you the option of being volume controls OR a pause play button. But not both.

The sync is off by half a second and it makes videos nearly unwatchable.

I previously had an older set of Sony headphones that I got back probably around 2013. They lasted me 6 years and I loved every second of using them. So, when they eventually broke back in July of this year I was tempted to buy a cheap pair of headphones but ended up deciding to spend the extra money and go with Sony again because of how much I loved the old ones which were now unavailable. These seemed to be the newer version of the old one I had so naturally I was expecting everything the old pair had and maybe even a better feel or sound quality. What I got was extremely disappointing. The Sound: actually a little bit worse than the old ones I had, simply just okay. The Quality/Feel: seemed like they were made extremely cheap and the uncomfortable feel of them showed that. I could maybe only wear these for about 30 minutes before it started hurting my ear and making me extremely uncomfortable.

I don't know if the best play for headphones is 300 dollars ones, I have never invested that amount of money into headphones. I feel like if headphones are something you use daily, then investing in 300 dollar headphones might be the best bet. If said 300 dollar headphones last longer than at least 5 years. I wouldn't purchase these headphones again. I waited to write the review on these headphones, specifically for this reason. If you are going to buy cheap headphones, don't buy this.

In terms of quality sound I would say is good . However is not loud enough to shut down outside chats and noise. If noise cancelling is on then the sound quality is a little bit muffled. Noise Canceling : the main reason to buy this was NC. when first used you have that effect that suddenly all noise are cancelled but in a minute or two you realize is not . you can hear AC, highway car noise etc. this are all low freq noise . Voices are very sharply listened using NC. they seem even amplified. Maybe the seal of the ear muffle is not good but I can not tell for sure Comfort: They look sleek, they look awesome . They stay flat. the pad on the bow between ears is really good . However the ear mufflers or pads are rather small and if you use this for more that 4 hours as I do the lobe of the ear will start hurting as is clipped under the mufflers.

However I did buy a much more expensive pair of earbuds that have ambient noise microphone so when I have the earbuds in I am able to hear my surroundings too. When I walk around with them in my ear, they don't allow enough (per myself) ambient sound through. But it's hard to compare considering these are only $40 bucks. I think they make a great pair of earbuds for intermittent use, but I can't see myself wearing these for 5-9 hours a day.

The issue occurs whether I'm calling someone through my iPhone, or through my Macbook Pro using VoIP. Sometimes it disconnects after about 20 minutes, sometimes it's 5 minutes. When it disconnects I need to turn the headphones off, then back on again for them to reconnect. It's very common for me to go through this process about 3-4 times in an hour long meeting. Each cycle of turning my headphones off, then on again takes about 30 seconds. The call doesn't hang up, it just disconnects the headphones from whatever device I'm on and the call continues. Sometimes when i'm talking I don't even realize the headphones disconnected, there's no warning, so one second I'm talking then I go silent to everyone else. I've reached out to support 3 time, finally got a response and they said I needed to send the headphones in for a replacement which will take 6-8 weeks. Having said all the above, take the calling issues out of the equation these are the best headphones I've ever had. If you fly a lot and binge movies these bad boys will last without charge on a long-haul to the other side of the world. I've taken these with me to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and China long-hauls. Adaptive noise cancelling is awesome, although I do find myself always maxing out the noise cancelling. Being able to pull the headphones and having them automatically pause is a nice feature that works great. As an example, if you're sitting on an airplane in the middle of a movie and the flight attendant comes by to give snacks and drinks, or you're sitting in an exit row and they just need to hear you say \"Yes\" the headphones will pause whatever you're watching until you put them back on again. If you're not wanting to make phone calls with these headphones they're 5-start headphones, and as far as I'm concerned the best on the market. If you're needing to make a lot of calls, I'd recommend the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.", "review_title": "Disconnects when on phone calls randomly, everything else is great.", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

They offer great noise control on airplanes, and otherwise sufficiently dull ambient hum and office chatter to allow you to focus (but they do not create \"silence\" or anything near it). The noise canceling is good enough to allow me to listen to podcasts and music while vacuuming. But there are several important issues with the product: 1) There is a subtle popping when used on buses and trains and sometimes when walking (or at least this is the case for my product). I think it has something to do with the noise canceling feature when the product is vibrated or exposed to small pressure changes. I had noticed this once or twice in the first year of use, but it didn't both me since I wasn't using it in those settings. But as my usage increased in these settings it became unbearable. Now I am taking the bus weekly and the product is effectively unusable. The warranty expired before I realized this might be covered, and I resent that Bose offers a default 2-year warranty in Europe but not in the U.S. 2) The ear-cuff material has degraded (cracking, flaking) despite careful use on my part. I take pains to keep the material clean and away from chemicals (always storing in the case when not wearing it), and I am disappointed that it seems this is not a product that will last for a long time after all. 3) The controls and software are clumsy and distracting. The advent of the app has allowed me to turn off the very annoying robot repeatedly listing the devices I am connected to (or not). The beeps however cannot be turned off nor can their volume be adjusted, resulting in loud noises that are unwelcome and frustrating. 4) The microphone design picks up ambient noise and amplifies it for a person on the other end of phone calls. Consequently, distant barking and ambulances can be louder than you to the listener. This is particularly a problem with crinkling sounds, which I have been told are extremely vivid to those on the other end of the line. I have not tried out the Bose competitors, but until these issues are resolved I'm planning to for my next purchase.", "review_title": "Pressure \"pops\" in some settings, material issues, clumsy controls", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

But, as many other reviewers mentioned, the smell of tobacco was so strong it made me gag -I say this having been a cigarette smoker for the past 15 years. It's too much, and would definitely funk up anything you store in it if you don't take certain measures yourself to make it dissipate. I aired it out and regularly applied essential oil droplets to it for about four or five days, and that eventually took care of it.

Edit: Charging case is still the major detriment to this product along with the only way to turn it on/off being removing it or putting it back in the charging case. As the connection to the case is temperamental, the earbuds often become loose in the case and will randomly pair to my phone. This causes it to disconnect from other devices and connect to the headphones unexpectedly.", "review_title": "Temperamental charging case but good earbuds.", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

Sitting next to my class D amplifier with the cool blue lights on and the gold finish on the nobs looked very cool. Unfortunately when I plugged these in line between my source and my amp and powered it on it gave the speakers a large pulse which made sort of a BOOM sound. When I turned the preamp on and off I kept getting the boom sound which made me feel like it could be sending too large of a signal into my speakers, potentially damaging them.

After you get the stylus out the first time it comes out without an issue (it might be connected by plastic before you break the seal inside? I'm not sure, but now it is very easy to get out, but still locks into place so it won't randomly fall out of the bottom). The stylus is exactly the same size and length of the stylus in the 2ds xl (I tried putting the stylus from the grip into the system and it fit perfectly). The stand on this works fine and feels sturdy. I don't think it would break easily. The overall feel of the grip is okay.

I moved to a more expensive product, hoping it would perform far and away better than the less expensive brands I tried - particularly based on the number of positive reviews from others. My primary use will be running/gym, and several other reviews indicated these were great for exercising. My experience, however, was far from positive. Here's why: - I have normal-sized ears; yet, the fit is very tight, with the earbud set deep into the ear canal (even with smaller ear tips). The earbuds stay in and block outside noise, but it is borderline painful keeping them in - When running, the music cuts out with each step. It's not a defect of the electronics, per se; rather when earbuds are dug this deeply into your ear canal, you're going to hear a \"thud\" every time you take a step, no matter the product - The sound quality was hailed as amazing. I found the quality marginal, at best. There wasn't much bass as others claimed, and the high end was desperately lacking. No crispness, whatsoever. - As others mentioned, the case is not at all ergonomically designed. It is very difficult to open the case without accidentally dropping/tossing the entire case. I fear the case will be destroyed in no time with several drops. - While I appreciate the ability to accomplish several tasks with just one multi-function button on each ear (i.e., skip forward/back, volume, etc.) you must push the button hard, which shoves them deeper into your ear, making for a more uncomfortable fit. So, I am still in search of a decent pair of wireless earbuds that will allow me to run at the gym or outside that a) won't fall out, b) will fit comfortably, and c) provides decent sound. The only product that has ever performed well is the LG Tone - which, I wanted to avoid because of the neck bands - but, I may consider moving back to a Tone-type headset, simply because no other wireless earbud has come close to offering the same comfort and sound quality.

GOOD: If you really have to, you can crank it and recharge the battery. It has weather bands. It takes 2 kinds of batteries (the built in special battery pack and AAA batteries). BAD: If you are using it for a regular radio, it goes dead FAST! Both batteries will be dead within a few hours unless you have it at low volume. It does not have save favorite stations. You have to turn and turn the knob to find them each time. Also, (very annoying) you can't hear if you hit a station unless you turn it one click and stop and listen.It mutes when turning the knob!. So, unless you know the exact station number, it takes forever to search for a station. Oh, also, when you pick it up you will hit the flashlight button on the top corner and accidentally turn on the flashlight. You will not notice it during the day and your battery will be dead.

They could have used much bigger rechargeable battery, a type that is commonly available, not a special battery pack that you have to get from them or a battery supplier. They could have designed it for much more disposable battery capacity (say 2 or even 4 D cells). It would be so much better if it saved your favorite stations.

I was looking for a replacement for my sansa clip sport that I've had for years and finally died. This one was recommended online, so I gave it a shot...and I totally regret it. The sound quality and battery life are good, but there are times that I hit the \"on\" switch and nothing happens - I have to click it on/off a few times before it responds. That in itself is annoying, but the worst thing for me is that when I turn the unit on, it leaps backward in the audiobook and I have to skip forward to find where I stopped last. This happens every time. I also don't like the general design of the player - the buttons are not intuitive to the user and overall it feels very cheap compared to my old sansa clip. I've kept it too long to return it (probably should have tried it out sooner) so I will deal with it for a while but I am already planning on buying another sansa to replace it. UPDATE AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF USE: I still hate this thing. The whole setup still feels weird to me. I figured out how to turn it off without losing my place in the audiobook -- you have to hold down the play/pause button until it counts down from three, rather than hitting the off switch. (Umm...why do I need to turn it off this way instead of just using OFF?) And now, somehow, \"shuffle\" has been turned on, and I can't find where to turn it off.

The thing needs power so need to have the TV on to power it up.

Sure its easy to do but when you get into the habit of having to reboot your receiver every 2nd time you want to watch TV it gets a little tedious.

Very disappointed. The sound quality is good enough, but the design has some major deficiencies. These include: 1. The Playbar has only one optical audio input. Most people on the planet have more than one device. In my case, I have a DirecTV receiver and a Panasonic smart TV for Netflix and Amazon programming. There is no way to plug two digital optical audio cables in to the Playbar. Sonos tech support says you have to add a 3rd party optical audio switch like the J-Tech optical switch which I did. It works well enough but you end up with another box, another remote, and a bunch more cables to hook everything up. Very clumsy setup and inconvenient to operate. What's the point of having wireless speakers if you end up with a bunch of cables anyway? Also, to switch back and forth from DirecTV to Netflix or Amazon, you have to manually switch the audio to get sound. Frustrating. The Playbar needs multiple optical audio inputs and the capability to manage audio inputs internally, (like a traditional AV receiver does). 2. I expected the WiFi network setup for the Sonos to be plug and play. It was a nightmare. I have a Ubiquiti AP for WiFi and a TP-Link wired router. The Sonos is not compatible with the Ubiquiti AP which is a pretty common interface. Even hard wiring the Sonos to my TP-Link wired router did not work. I could see the Sonos from my router, but the Sonos will not complete the setup process without a WiFi connection (the Sonos hard wiring feature is really useless). After 4 hours on the phone with Sonos tech support, my network would not work at all. The Sonos tech reset my WiFi access point and nothing worked after that. They gave up. After 4 more hours on the phone with Ubiquiti tech support and several days researching myself, I finally got my network back up and was able to complete the Sonos setup process. The fix is complicated and too much to get into here. I have many other devices on my network and have never had such problems with them. 3. The Sonos speaker shadows the IR receiver for my TV remote. I have to hold it over my head for it to work. Minor issue but annoying. If I had it to do over again, I would not go with the Sonos Playbar and Sub.

Often, playback is stopped as a result of these interactions. Con: The remote works, but reception at the unit is a little sketchy from just a couple feet away. Often have to push buttons more than once to get the unit to respond. Con: The headrest mounting case has a strap that covers the On/Off switch in the unit. Since you cannot toggle the unit's power from the remote, it can make things awkward. Con: The cigarette lighter adapter has a short cord (two feet long, tops).

They are beautiful looking headphones that are made of great quality. If you only want to 'look' at your headphones...buy these now! 2. The sound (which is most important) underperformed. I have a pair of $40 Ausdom bluetooth headphone that sounds waaaay better from mid-high and especially lows. 3. The bluetooth kept disconnecting on ALL of my devices. This never happened with my cheap ones. 4. I believe like another reviewer mentioned...they are ear heavy. This part didn't bother me too much, as they were still fairly comfortable and not too tight. However, somehow there is an imbalance with the weight of the top part (that goes over your head) because with even doing light activities while wearing them they would start to fall off. Again, my cheapies never had this problem and I've had them for over a year. 5. No bag, case or really any extras besides the charging usb cord and aux cord for when you're not using the bluetooth. This would've been perfectly fine if the main purpose was fulfilled (\"the sound\"). 6. All in all, I loved the name of the headphones (which did influence my purchase) and the look. Using real leather is something that is usually on more expensive headphones. But because these are headphones, not a handbag they still need to sound great too. It's like a beautiful woman with no personality or a bad attitude...not worth the headache. 7. Perhaps an updated version would greatly suit this product and I would remain optimistic in giving them a second chance.", "review_title": "I really wanted to like these", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

The sounds quality is good. I do not consider myself an audiophile but I can tell lousy from decent when it comes to headphones and these fit squarely in the decent category, Cons: There is a severe delay when using Bluetooth (1-2 seconds) so much so that I gave up on using the bluetooth. I just plug them in using the USB-C to 1/8\" cable. It makes watching movies using Bluetooth a no-go with these headphones. I also notice the delay when pausing music. There is a 1-2 second lag from when I hit the pause button to when music actually stops. Noise cancelling doesn't do much more than add white noise to the audio. Build quality is mediocre. I have owned these 8 months and the power button broke (it is stuck depressed so I can no longer turn the headphones on). I wasn't expecting these to be awesome, but losing the Bluetooth functionality completely after 8 months seems pretty bad. The padding is also coming loose as shown in the photo.

After almost an hour on the phone, I finally got him to send me the pole \"Free of charge\" Umm I paid for it!! It took 2 days to get the antenna. It took an additional week to receive the mounting pole. As far as an improved signal. Yeah, not so much. If anything, I get less channels now. And if you don't have it mounted where you can see it, you don't know where it's pointing. In other words. I'm still looking for a new antenna.

The thick jacket and heavy duty plug prevent this cable from fitting into the pocket in the back of my Vizio M Series TV or next to any other HDMI cable in an adjacent socket on my Sony ES receiver. Here is the naked truth about HDMI cables: they either work or they don't, and there is no such thing as a premium passive cable. There are only 3 possible outcomes with any given HDMI cable: 1. Does not work 2. Works with artifacts (random white dots) 3. Works If your outcome is 1 or 2, your equipment does not like the cable, or you need an active cable for a long run. If your outcome is 3, you are good to go. There is no higher quality level than \"works,\" considering the error-corrected digital nature of how HDMI signals are transmitted. That is a long-winded explanation of why this cable is unnecessarily thick. Thicker absolutely does not mean more \"premium\" -- just more difficult to use. Or, in my case, impossible to use.

However I thought I could set them up properly (anchored to the VR cable instead of it running loosely through the carabiners). for 22.00 I was willing to take the gamble. The retract mechanisms (yo yo's). They feel pretty cheaply made but do function. I was intending to use just 1 or 2 to hold my cord up but found that they are very weak and I have to use 3 of them for my setup. I will keep the other 3 as spares in case these break. The cable its self is a very thin steel cable with a plastic coating on it. They are secured with little collets which have a grub screw that you can loosen up with an included tool ( one tool per yo yo) to make the loop smaller or shorten the pull out length which would likely increase the pull strength. These grub screws seem to really pinch the cable and I am worried about it fatiguing the cables causing a failure. Time will tell The sticky pad hooks... Total garbage, have another plan on how to secure the yo yo's to the wall or a fishing pole above you. These will looks god awful on your wall and they are really not the right design to hold the yo yo's and you will likely have problems with the yo yo's coming off the hooks if you actually use them The included carabiners are very low quality as well but get the job done.

Firstly, I bought these batteries for my Xbox One controller. They work well for this one, though I cannot use them in every other device on account of their large size, which seems to be rather normal for rechargeable batteries, though it is a good reason to dislike these a bit. After a while, I begun to realize that these batteries, for whatever reason, did not output as much power. Using them in the controller, or lights, or whatever evidenced that they were weaker than standard aa batteries. After a complete charge, they are on par, but it only takes 24 hrs, and they are weaker again. It appears that these batteries self-discharge incredibly quickly. This is disappointing because the batteries say \"low self-discharge\" on the package, and this is certainly not true. Using a device for measuring battery power, I can definitely say that a very sizable chunk of the power from a charge will have dissipated on the next day without even using the batteries. This all wouldn't be so bad, except that it makes it seem also like the batteries are more useful than they are. Originally, I thought very soon that I had already reimbursed myself for these batteries very quickly, but noticing that much of they power they deliver is subpar, and that much of the power is wasted simply through self-discharge, I can say that I probably haven't begun saving money yet by using these batteries. So, in conclusion, it's nice to get a charger and to have rechargeable batteries, but these batteries are sub-par when compared to alkaline lithium batteries, and they don't last as long. It will take quite some time before these will become profitable for the buyer. However, they are probably more eco friendly than buying AA batteries. Nevertheless, these are NOT low self-drain batteries.There may therefore be better options, especially because it takes forever for this charger to charge the self-discharging batteries.", "review_title": "Not bad, but not good either.

For example I have no idea what a motherboard is. I am good at reading instructions and have a lot of patience. For example, I have put together a houseful of IKEA furniture without any problems. Yesterday I replaced my battery and it was challenging to say the least. I wasn't impressed with tools they provided other than the screw drivers and suction cup (more on that later). The instruction pamphlet is not sufficient at all so I don't know why they even bother to include it. It gives you a false sense that you can replace the battery using these instructions. After you go through some of the steps you then realize that there is no way you can replace the battery without going on the website and reading through the much more detailed instructions. Getting the battery out of the phone was dreadful. I started this process before I watched the video. Perhaps if I would have been more careful with removing the glue strips under the battery, my experience would have been easier. Having said this, even the website instructions warn you that most people don't have success with removing the strips easily and end up prying the old battery out. I was so paranoid about bending or puncturing the battery and having it catching on fire (instruction warning) that it took me over 2 hours to pry it out. I finally had to use my own tools (a paint can lid opener and large screw driver) because I just couldn't get the leverage with their tools that they provided. I decided that the suggestion in the instructions to use dental floss was to just add more torture. I tried and of course it just ripped in half. I did end up puncturing a small hole in the old battery but I survived - no fire, nuclear explosion, etc.. I didn't disconnect the wires at the top of the phone (which would allow you to completely remove the top lid of the phone from the bottom lid) because they warn you that you can do just as much damage (if you are not super careful) doing this as leaving them intact. This requires you to keep the top part of the top lid on the phone somewhat engaged with the bottom part. It can't be opened from the bottom part of the phone by more than 90 degrees. Per the instructions if you don't disconnect the wires at the top, the phone lid can not be entirely removed and must be held open with one hand the whole time you are working on replacing the battery. Nonsense! That would have been impossible - you need both hands for this process! I attached the suction cup to the top lid and rigged it up to another solid object on my counter top so it stayed open at 90 degrees while I worked on the phone. I gave this product three stars entirely because of the instructions/tools. After I finally got the new battery in the phone, it worked and it is certainly holding a charge much better than my 2 hour max charge with my old one.", "review_title": "Replacing the Battery Was No Party!", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

The cord itself wiggles where the plastic plug meets the cord. Of course, she's probably a little harder on cords than we adults would be, but her other cords she's used have lasted much longer(i.e. 9 mnths to 1yr, or more depending on brand, and style). We've learned, and have taught her the right, and wrong way to use them, so there's no way a well built cord would last only a couple of uses, either way. I'm debating whether to send them all back, or ask for a single replacement, because we really needed the 10 ft. cord for our vacation in a few weeks, and I don't want to realize after it's too late that it wasn't just a single faulty cord, (which it might be). I'm not sure what to change my 5 star review to, due to this happening with 1 out of 4. Of course, we're not even using 2 of them yet. Original review: These are good, micro USB cords. I have tested all 4 cords, and they all work. We go through cords in our house with a busy schedule, and so many electronics, so we either lose them, or they eventually stop charging right. I have bought so many cords over the years, and sometimes they've been good, some are okay, and some don't work, or not all of the cords work. I try to do my research before buying, and read the reviews. We haven't had these for long, so I will update once we've had them longer, or if we have any problems. As you can see in my pic, there are only 2 cords left in the pack, because my daughter, and husband have already snagged one. So far, they're working great, and it's a great value, which is even better.", "review_title": "1 cord BROKE within 3 days!", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

This is absolutely the failure point of this device as it is inadequate for heat transfer if it was anything like mine when I received it. There was solder in only 2 of the via holes out of 18 or so on the board. A couple were completely dry, the rest had some solder in them but would never make heat transfer contact with the sink. I scrubbed off the conformal coating and applied a thin layer of solder to coat the via's then applied a small amount of cpu thermal paste and reinstalled the sink.

I fully charged the it and oddly enough it seems to work ok as long as it has a good charge. I have never had an electronic component act like that before. The receivers work fair. I have had false positives and negatives. I have trail cams set up and have had animals walk by (caught on camera) where I received no alert.

The sound quality just wasn't what I consider adequate. I am giving them three stars though as they did pair easily and function well otherwise. The buttons on them don't control the volume which actually is a good thing - your iPhone is supposed to do that and ones that have it on the cord sort of run at cross-purposes. The speaker element is a bit big but I still was able to cram it into my little ears. And with the smallest set of silicone earbuds that came with it, these fit snuggly in my narrow ear canals. I bought these because for Christmas last year I got a similar product for my daughter and they work great and sound spectacular (great bass and good reproduction all the way up to the treble range). However, I just got a iPhone 11 Pro Max and it doesn't pair with the older BlueTooth for some reason (get with it Apple and fix this!). So I went for these BT 5.0 ones and it did pair nicely. But the sound quality was really noticeably lacking especially when I compared them to the same songs on my daughter's setup (iPhone X + $19 sport headphones). I even made sure to play with the EQ settings on both so they matched. The \"small speaker\" setting seemed the best for these but even that couldn't boost what was required to get things sounding decent. Mostly there was distortion in the frequencies that were lacking if boosted. I listen to music at probably just slightly over normal volume but not \"blasting\"... so this is not normally a problem for me. For around $15 they are likely just o.k. I just hoped for more and would have gladly paid 2x that price to get it. So I am back on the hunt...", "review_title": "Sound quality was a deal-breaker for me (returned them)", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

The leatherette pads seem to seal nicely which maybe be part of how these are meant to help with noise but they just aren't comfortable for long listening sessions. My main interest in these was the active noise canceling (which is decent) and the aptX wireless (because normal BT audio sounds terrible) for use at work. I was glad to find these which are aesthetically clean and professional looking and they have a mic which I was hoping to use with conference/video calls at work. Unfortunately the mic on these is good but omnidirectional which means that when I'm on a call everyone can hear me and the whole room around me. It seems there was no attempt to help make the mic a little more directional so that room sounds wouldn't come in just as well as the wearer or if there was it certainly didn't work well. In my previous office where there were fewer people and we were more spread out it wasn't too bad but in my new space, which is busier, it's a problem. This is pretty frustrating as I like the sound, look, and convenience of the wireless. These would be perfect for me if the mic was better at ignoring background sounds and noises. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find anything else on the market today that looks like would be any better for under $400. There's some headsets that could maybe be better for conference calls but lack aptX or AAC for music listening. The newer and much more expensive PXC 550, from the specs, might have a better mic but at neatly $200 more that seems a bit steep for a better mic.", "review_title": "Great sound, aptX support, but the built in mic for calls is terrible.", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

But some of the buttons do not work and I can't change channel outputs without manually pressing the button on the main unit. The number 2 and 3 buttons do not work, and the number 1 and 4 buttons have to be pressed really hard for the IR receiver to catch the signal. Needless to say, this is going back.

That's a nice feature. They come in a compact box because the cabinets are actually made up of three rectangular shaped units. That helps to make them fairly strong once they are put together with the back panels. I have been putting together press board furniture for 30+ years and have seen the parts quality and chip board quality decrease. This is about as low in quality as I have seen yet, but it still works to suit a purpose. There is a faint chemical smell from these. The best way I have to put these together is to put the top box together first on a carpeted floor, square up the box and attach the back panel, then attach the second box, square it up again and attache the back panel, etc. I used some glue I had around for strength. The dowel pins are small. I have never seen them that thin before, but again they do the job. I bought two and have only put together the first one so far. The only thing I will do differently with the second one is to use small finish nails instead of the easily bendable things they provide. They should have provided plastic covers for the cams, but once the cabinets are loaded they are not visible. There are small holes in the top panel to secure the cabinet to the wall. I would have preferred that they not leave holes in there. Once fully put together the cabinets look decent and are fairly sturdy. They are just the right size to have six rows of DVDs or Blu Rays. The main reason I got these is because they fit in very small spaces and I needed extra storage. If I was looking for something more permanent, I definitely would look at other products. As it is these should be viewed as cheap and disposable but good for the purpose they are made for. I had thought about using two cabinets and building them so they are five boxes high instead of three. May still try that, and if I do it would be necessary to anchor them to a wall. The back panels are not really configured to do that because their interlocking \"jigsaw\" pattern is specific to three boxes, but it may be worth a try to save floor space. A wall of these things could look pretty cool and would be functional.", "review_title": "Cheap but effective storage solution for small spaces", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

I am purely doing this review to let others know about this product along with many others out there that have gave a similar review. With that in mind let me tell you all about these sweet pair of headphones. These are my first \"noise cancelling\" headphones and I say it like that because they only really cancel some sounds, not all. Now I have tried on other headsets, such as Sony or Bose, but after further review I want something that was cheaper for the time being that were comfortable, have a long battery life, and crisp sound/good bass. After first turning them on I did have that initial sound that was crackling but after one song it went away, however I haven't had them long so if it is consist I'll add a edit later. Anyway, these are a fairly solid pair of wireless ANC headphones if your on a budget or don't care about brand recognition. TaoTronics have some fairly solid other products too but this is the only one I have truly tried out. Pros: Battery life, anything that I don't have to charge once a day and more life once a week is a major win in my book and on top of that the charge time is fairly quick as far as my experience as seen with it so far. Comfort, I can quickly tell that these won't hurt after several hours of wearing them. You might get some mild discomfort/ear sweat if you have them on and it's hot out but other then that nothing so far for me. Price, enough said. Cons: Not a recognized brand? Some people are seriously loyal to their brands and will buy any amount of money. ANC isn't as good as others but still works well enough. With that it is also worth mentioning that they will work good on trains or airplanes as long as you have something playing with it. You might still pick up some sounds but for the most part they are pretty solid.", "review_title": "With that in mind let me tell you all about these sweet pair of headphones", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

I recommend these even in the face of the following [somewhat questionable] complaints: They were very easy for me to put together, but I have a great concept of three-dimensional manipulation and am quite dexterous. There are a lot of things you have to hold in place with your fingers before being able to bolt it all together. They're heavy for their size and an odd shape, which may make assembly annoying for some. The plastic plates which cover the mounting bracket aren't affixed to the frame in any way. Bass frequencies cause these to slide along the frame, and thus off the wall, very frequently. Even when just listening to spoken word. I'm sure some sticky tack will fix this, but I have none on hand. The second picture in this review highlights this issue. There are holes in the frame through which one can run speaker wire. This is a great feature, but unfortunately while these holes are large enough for speaker wire, they are too small for speaker cables and power cables. I am using powered speakers, so these holes serve me no purpose. The acorn nuts protruding from the base of the mounts lend an industrial aesthetic; which is not in my favor, but only a concern now that I am inspecting the items for this review. They're not horrendous, just make sure you don't scratch the black paint off of them. I wish they had a higher range of motion. In the first picture for this review, they are tilted down as far as they go. Due to the size of my monitor, and wall studs being 16\" on-center, this was the only place I could install them. They are aimed slightly above my head; which is not ideal for music production, but works perfectly fine. All in all, this is a great product.

Funny thing, if you press them close to your head, you get more treble, but if you have a bit of a gap, you hear more bass. The volume does not stand up to a windy bike ride. They are molded in such a way as to not be adjustable, so that they may not sit in the position for optimal conduction unless you rig it just so. That really needs to be addressed.

So, since my gloves is bad, I decided to look for a glove with wrist protection belt. Came across the Gym Gloves by Sahara. I thought it looks neat and price meet my expectation. Upon wearing the glove, it seems to be big and loose. The wrist belt was long enough to wrap around the wrist a few times. After wearing the glove for 1 hour, my palm does not feel warm or hot. The grip or palm area is made of some breathable fabric materials. It is not full leather but the new type of materials is nice to hold the equipment with the anti slip pad on the glove. 1 thing I don't fancy too much is the knuckle that is sticking out from the gloves. I find it too big and don't serve any purpose. So far, I am happy with this product. So far, I am happy with this product.

After the second look I realized these were knock-off Milwaukee Tool imitation products. I am returning and have ordered the real thing as replacement. I wish these had worked as these are 2.5 amps while the newly ordered Milwaukee is only 2.0 amps. Update - in looking at other reviews it seems that others have likewise received bad batteries. Not a good sign. But to be fair, the supplier offered prompt and free replacement. I was not able to take advantage as I had ordered Milwaukee instead since there was a time crunch on my project. Because of the sellers quick offer to replace I have improved the rating to four stars.", "review_title": "Seemed like a Deal", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

Uber App also eats up my battery, so I needed the wireless charging on the fly. This product fit the bill. It was high quality, had hands that automatically 'grabbed' my phone, and it had a lot of flexibility. Alas, after 6 weeks it would no longer hold my phone on dash or glass. The suction cup (with the very sticky coating) would no longer hold. And, magically, my 'return date' expired after 4 weeks, so I'm out $40. Granted, I have it stretched out pretty far to hold my large I-phone 8+, but it still failed. My only option is to drill holes in my dash to hold it. UPDATE: Very pleased to be contacted by the manufacturer, and found excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE in resolving my problem. They sent me a new unit, and it works just fine. However, I decided to forego the suction cup option, because it just won't work for my application. To extend the arm all the way out, weighted by an I-phone 8+, will defy physics: at some point it will fall and fail. I had avoided air vent holders in the past, simply because they heat or chill the phone too much, depending upon what you're running through the vents. So I thought I'd give this option a try. This unit tends to block the air, so the phone stays normal. This option is excellent and sturdy, and I'm pleased going with this set-up, as opposed to the 'suction-arm.' While I've only used this new product for a week, I have high hopes. It is good quality, the movable clamps are very functional, and it has solved my Uber Eats problem with my phone. Highly recommend.", "review_title": "GOOD FOR 6 WEEKS: Updated", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

At first listen they were 'just ok', kind of hard and muffled sounding, but they broke in after a day of playing at a moderately loud volume and opened up a bit.. which is typical .. but it was still a little unexpected for me. So, give 'em a good crank and let them play for a day or 2 before you evaluate them critically. I don't understand why you'd use a spring-clip speaker input for these. Simple spades would be better.

The mechanism to open is to push the side with your thumb. The internal plastic seems a little cheap but for the price, I do not expect premium and the outside it just fine. You would definitely need to use both hands to open the case, one to keep it still while the other actually does the pushing. The labeling on the inside of the case and on the device itself is nice to make sure you do not mix the left and right one up. Otium claims that the case says it can get 2.5 hours of charging and the headphones themselves last for 1.5 hours. This sounds about right with how they have worked for me. Compared to products like airpods and galaxy buds that is not a long time so if you were on the go these might not help you if you are not near an outlet. The case is charger is micro usb but I really wish I saw a USB type C charger. The buds themselves came with many different size options for your ears. The buds are conformable fitting in the ear for me. I did have to look at the manual to figure out how to set them up but it was not hard or time consuming at all. They do connect to themselves and they say connected which is a little strange because the first assumption is the voice saying connected would mean that it was connected to my phone, which was not the case. The buds at top volume are not as blasting as I can get my wired earphones at, which I would assume most people would not want to damage their ears anyway but that is a thing to keep in mind. It does a good job keeping most ambient noise out. The range on the Bluetooth is not that bad but you are usually going to be near your device anyway. When you put them back into the case it shows that they light up when they charge which is a nice feature. When I pull them back out they connect to my phone within a few seconds. When I went on a run with them they did not move at all and the sweat did not damage them. After using them for about a week my biggest con to them would be the battery life and the case size. The buds have died on me and I wish they could last longer. The case size is not ideal, especially if you do not have deep or lose pockets. That being said, for the price and what you get, these are not bad at all. These are perfect for people who want the wireless earbuds but do not also want to break the bank.", "review_title": "Quality product without breaking the bank", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks.

This speaker came in handy, they were able to use it most of the ride, they put it on the window it was getting charged well they were playing music and just having fun. Especially with the bus with no charging station, this feature was off the hook, the solar charging. All of his friends had talked about it, snap chatted about it. Very convenient, easy connect via Bluetooth, The sound quality is amazing, it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s clear, and you can actually feel the bass as well, super amazing charge features.

The build is excellent, made out of very strong plastic. The speaker has good insulation from dust and water, providing some needed features that other high end speakers don\u2019t have. Build: In my testing the speaker held out really well. I took it to camp to test out the durability. This speaker held out really well. The front amps get very loud when paired by Bluetooth. In my case I used an iPhone XS. In my case i used the speaker while I was outside By the campfire. Battery: I tested the battery nonstop and noticed that I got easily 6-8 hours on constant use. In my defense my phone didn\u2019t last as long thus battery life is very subjective to the loudness and if Bluetooth is use. I mostly connected the device via Bluetooth. Features: The main features that this speaker has are the micro sd card slot, and microphone built in. I used the speaker for offline use by transmitting music via bluetooth. Because I was camping the service in my area was fairly poor, thus just adding my whole music library to the micro sd or usb is very convenient.", "review_title": "Excellent sounding Speaker", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

I do not want to pay a lot of money for TV channels I do not see too often, and then I discovered this antenna.

I really didn't think in advance that all the stations would come in as sharp and clear, but they do. It is very easy to set up the antenna and it is well described in the manual. The only difficult part is to find the best spot to find the antenna to receive most channels and channels without major disturbances. I discovered that by moving the antenna just an inch could have a major impact on the number and channels and the picture quality. I got most channels and the best picture by placing the antenna high up on a window. I was able to get approx 49 channels (including NBC, ABC, PBS, FOX, and many others). We recently cut cable, so we bought this antenna to pick up a ball game that was airing on a local channel. Everything operated as expected and the picture quality is excellent.

I use them at the gym, when I'm walking the public parks, and even just to watch a movie on my cell, or listen to music. They're pretty sturdy, the sound is actually really good, and I literally throw them in a purse, backpack, etc. Very impressed, won't be getting any other ear buds again!", "review_title": "Very Impressed - Can't recommend enough!", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

They arrived at 10:00 am the following day. Set up is freaky Fast, zero issue. One time & Done. Here's the Best Part. Put em on. Crisp - Clear - Concise. The sound is superior and I was streaming Pandora on my cell. This works even better when I streamed from a Surface Pro. You can read the specs on why this is called a Quiet Comfort for accuracy, but as I recall it blocks out sounds within like a 100th of a millisecond.

We were driving on a bumpy gravel road and I couldn\u2019t hear anything except for the music that was playing! The sound quality is great! It is also very loud!

It allows me to see her speed, received notifications if there is sharp turning or braking, and also provides a history of where she has been. I can get exact coordinates of her location and times which has already come in handy in a big way. We received a call from the police department that there was an accident and the person who was driving hit another vehicle and drove away. The vehicle was similar to my daughter's and she was in the same town when the accident occurred! I was able to pull up the tracking history and see she was not in the same location where the accident occurred at that time through the tracker. Also, her vehicle did not show any damage thankfully. The tracker saved us a lot of hassle and concern. PS She is unaware the tracker is on her vehicle.

Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.", "review_title": "Simply does not work as described", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

The quality is not what it used to be. I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.", "review_title": "**DO NOT BUY** This product used to be excellent, but not anymore.

It can be charged without removing it and this is its biggest selling point over competitors.

It actually only lasts between 3 and 4 hours. I contacted the seller and they responded: \"Hello, Thanks for your message, this adapter's battery life is about 5 hours, so it is normal to be that.

I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.", "review_title": "Good when they worked - failed after 4 months", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}
