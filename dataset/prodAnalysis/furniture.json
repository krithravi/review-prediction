I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 12th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road.

But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight.

At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all! What a shame.", "review_title": "Nice looking junk!", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

The other two were much smaller. They seem to be adequate for what we use them for. One sections the paper has wrinkled and some of the hinges are loose but overall adequate. Now one problem we encountered with this item that we did not have with the other two is a strong smell of formaldehyde. That's what I said formaldehyde. The outside of the box even indicates that they used formaldehyde when making this and the other two room dividers. The odor on this one was so strong that we had to place it in our sunroom windows open to get rid of the odor. Factually, we had not even read the box the last two purchases because their just wasn't any odor, I still had the box from the last order and sure enough it too said formaldehyde, I think the seller should make us aware that they used formaldehyde, especially since since this is know to cause some medical problems. Had I know ahead of time I don't think I would have made these purchases. California requires a Prop 65 warning on the item which was on the box. I have COPD and this certainly can affect those without breathing problems, formaldehyde is also thought to cause cancer. Because this wasn't disclosed until after I made the purchase I give it one star. Hopefully leaving it in my sunroom with windows open will get rid of the odor and make it safer to use.", "review_title": "Caution formaldehyde used to make this item", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

It did NOT expand to 12 inches! It was 10\" on all sides though,not like some people's reviews that said it was uneven all around,or received moldy or smelly beds. Mine is clean as shown in the picture and I didn't notice any strong smells,just a faint odor that went away after a day or two. I took a picture after it stopped expanding,and while the covering was slightly loose in one area,the bed looks pretty. I have back problems and this mattress has NOT helped. I purposely waited to write this review after sleeping on it for a week. One review said the bed felt soft and firm at the same time and I wondered how could that be? I don't know but she was right! If you like a firm mattress then you'll probably like this,though some said it gets softer as time goes on. I personally have been having back pain every morning so I will be adding a soft foam topper to put over it! I'm a senior and my daughter and I (mostly my daughter) put this on top of the Xl Twin box springs that came in a King frame I ordered. So after having to get rid of my old bed and all the money I paid for a new King size frame, and new box springs and the bed in a box I was not going to donate it and get a receipt like I've read that Zinus has you do in order to get a refund!!! I read from one review that a guy called Amazon and they helped him so I gave it a shot! I explained that I didn't want to return the bed, but since I was paying for a 12\" bed and my bed is only 10\" that I should get a discount and that's what they did!

Here is a list of things I was disappointed about the chair. First of all, the build quality. The arm rests are held together by two screws, one at the top and one at the bottom. Not a very good design. I always feel like I'm going to break the arm rests whenever I put my arms on them. It's very wobbly no matter how hard I tighten the screws. What's worse is, if you break the threading in one of the screw holes, it's over, the arm rest won't stay. The back is held to the seat by a thin metal plate with 3 screws. Also not a very good design. I want to lean back and the only thing preventing me from falling is 3 screws and a thin metal piece. I added a picture of the three screws connecting the small tab of metal to the seat. The foot rest also looks like it's going to break by the way it bends when I put my feet on it. The chair is slightly tilted to one side. It's too noticeable to let it pass. The handle for letting me recline is way to far for me to reach. I have to get out of my chair to pull the handle. The arm rests are way too wide and too tall for me to comfortably place my arms. Also, it smelled of oil, but it went away. Leaning back wasn't as comfortable as I thought. I always feel like I'm sliding out of the chair. But that's without the footrest. With it it's fine. I would have let this chair slide for its price had it not been for it's build quality. Had it been made a lot better, I would have said it was worth your money. Unfortunately, it could have been a lot better. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't a completely awful chair. The main reason I bought it was because it had a headrest. Aside from the arm rests and the slight tilting, the feeling of sitting in it wasn't too bad. If you know you're not going to break this chair and don't care too much about where you place your arms, you may find it comfortable.

I'd give it a 0/5 stars... whoever packaged this item decided it was good idea not to pad it... I received the box with a hole on the side.

I've already had an entire chunk of the desk break off (the wall piece on the back, behind the bigger portion of the L) Also, there's a major technical error: if you use the longer and deeper side of the desk (which I suspect most will), any chair with armrests that's wider than 23\" can not be under the desk due to the shelves, without bringing the left armrest under the smaller left side of the L completely.

This will not make your rug feel nicer or any softer. It will just make it slightly thicker. That, alone, was a little unfortunate. I kept telling myself, \"well at least it's protecting the hard wood floor\". My baby will fling her sippy cups around and although they don't leak much, some water will spill out. More often, my friend will spill a beer on the rug. We clean the rug but felt better about having this rubber backing. Like idiots, after something spilled, I don't know how many times we actually checked to make sure the pad caught the liquid. We probably had about four spills until we checked and we were SHOCKED to find that the liquid seeped through my rug and RIGHT THROUGH THE RUG PAD. What on earth is this for, then? It doesn't soften the rug when you're sitting or crawling on it. It doesn't protect my baby when she bumps her head (no more than the rug would without this pad) and it doesn't protect my floor!

I have come to really depend on the description, and the photo of the item, when I seen your item (BAMBOO Lacquered BED SHELF) It was more than perfect. Your item was the first one that I got real excited about, to the point that it made me think of all that I would need to go along with the BED TABLE! I\"V never done that EVER. Now I'm sorry, but you can't understand my hurt and disappointment, when I got the shelf! It was not at all what i seen on the add.I don't like returning things, I don\u2019t buy to return. But I made sure it went back the next day! I\"m not a picky person, and some things I can over look, nothings perfect.but, there was no way i could over look that shelf. SORRY, NO!, Like I said, i\"m new to this shopping stuff and i\"v come to not to expect too much. The only thing I\"v ordered that matches the photo and descript.

My mattress is 10 inches thick and it fits fine on the frame but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for children. Space underneath fits a desk and bookshelf easily! The downside is the ladder is incredibly uncomfortable to climb up and the trip down is also an inconvenience (especially if you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.) If you have the money, get a loft bed with steps. Also, this bed seems to shake A LOT which makes me question how stable it really is. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t break on me because I have my computer setup right underneath. One last thing, BE CAREFUL WHEN ASSEMBLING! When I was on the step of putting the foot and head of the bed together, the middle long pole broke slightly due to its own weight when I picked up the frame. I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t be a problem because of the other support beams on the bed. I don\u2019t think this should last more than a year or two.

We decided to give this little cabinet a shot. ASSEMBLY: It took me about 4 1/2 hours to put this cabinet together. If you are unfamiliar with carpentry, you might want to consider hiring someone to do the assembly. Honestly, the instructions were trash. They were worse than useless. If I didn't have experience building furniture, I would have been totally lost with this thing. About half of the time was spent dry fitting parts to ensure I had the right holes lined up. However, once I had it together, it seemed quite sturdy. One hint I'll leave for everyone: gluing the joints and allowing to dry before putting anything in or on the cabinet is always recommended with assemble-yourself furniture. The lack of clear instructions is the reason I'm removing a couple of stars from my rating. APPEARANCE: The color is even and pretty close to what was shown on the product page, perhaps a half shade lighter. Once assembled, the doors and drawers open and close smoothly and hang straight and flush to the cabinet body. The lines are clean and the cabinet sits on a firm base without any wobble or tilt. As you can see, even the material is MDF, it matches well with our existing pine furniture. OVERALL: We have had this cabinet about 6 weeks now, and we're quite pleased with it. It's fulfilled its purpose. Not shown is the ample storage space behind the doors, where my wife has stashed a bunch of her small electrics. The two drawers are also larger than you might think.

I have long legs, wear shorts most of the time, and move a lot, so the need for having a flexible chair is a must to have. This chair you need patience, patience, and a good back before you decide to put it together. There are so many small parts and somewhat complicated instructions that lack details. The tools kit that comes with the chair is useless. The wrench slips a lot, so expect to bump your fingers around the chair inners(not a pleasant experience). Once you managed to put it together, adjusting the chair is another headache on its own! This is where I am debating on returning or keeping this chair. There are six knee positions you can adjust this chair, and that is great, but the problem with is that you need to remove a long bolt holding the chair against a wall to stop it from collapsing flat on the growing-risking snapping your fingers-. There's another adjuster that it's designed to adjust the height, you have to get off the chair eyeball it to what you might like, sit and if that does not work, get back off and readjust again. You can't adjust it while sitting unless you have a strong grip, and I lift. In all, this is my first week using the chair, and already feel the benefit of having a knee chair. It helps balance the weight on my lower back. It's very comfortable, feels great moving around my workstation. I will def use it and if I decide to keep it will have to remove bolts to it from scratching me.

My old pillows always left my head tilted up slightly when on my back so it took time to accept that this new position was good. Maybe it's more mental than physical? My other comment is that I sleep on my side a lot. The support under my neck doesn't feel like it is there. Maybe I should get the firmer pillow to see if that does better - could be my size. I also wonder if it's me and the introduction to a totally new type of pillow makes it seem like there's not enough support for side-sleeping. I can say the amount of neck pain in the past few mornings seemed to have diminished. Still some lingering, but no where near what I had before. Took a few mornings to get to this place and so far I'm pretty happy. Would I buy another pillow like this, yes. I actually will buy the firmer one at some point to see if my hunch is right.

Being the complete newbies in DIY flooring we are, there were very noticable seams in the floor where a new sheet began so I wanted a rug big enough to cover them up. I wanted a 4 ft x 5 ft rug because that's how big my space was, and this was one of the only ones I could find in the material/colors I wanted in that size. Our flooring is true white & gray hexagon sheet vinyl. I read reviews that said that the rug was definitely off-white instead of true white, but i loved the print, the size and the material seemed perfect for a kitchen. Since our flooring is so stark white,by comparison it makes the rug seem even more brown than white. But, we plan to paint our lower cabinets black and install butcher block wood countertops so I'm thinking the colors of the rug will match better (the off-white/brown colors in the rug will pop with the countertops). So, to summarize, PROS: -I LOVE the pattern of the rug -the material seems very easy to clean in a kitchen (or outdoors) -it is pretty soft (not plasticy or scratchy like some rugs) considering it can be used as an outdoor rug -the size fits perfect in my space -THE PRICE IS AMAZING. BEST VALUE! CONS: -if you're putting the rug against a stark white floor or furniture, the rug will appear to be BROWN rather than off-white", "review_title": "Rug is more BROWN (tan) than white if paired with true white floors/furniture", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

It's roomy, comfortable and feels sturdy. I like that it's made for HON, which is a big office furniture company and I've used their products before. The chair arrived in a single carton, approximately 57 pounds. No damage to the packaging like other reviewers have noted. Everything was intact, undamaged and didn't show signs of prior use. Assembly took about 15-20 minutes using the provided hardware, hex key and instructions. Might have gone faster if I used a ratchet or power tool for the bolts, but not much to it: - insert casters in the star base, followed by the gas lift cylinder - attach mounting base to the seat (4 bolts), followed by the seat back (4 bolts) - attach the arms (4 bolts each, 8 total) - check bolts again for tightness - place seat on gas lift cylinder - sit & adjust as needed As another review noted, the assembly instructions has a couple steps out of order. You should attach the mounting base (J bolts) before the seat back (K bolts) since part of the mounting base goes under the end of the seat back bracket. If you follow the instructions as currently written, you'll have to undo the K bolts and remove 2 of them to attach the mounting base, then redo the K bolts. It's not a big deal, just hope the advice saves someone else the time. The chair itself is roomy with a thick seat cushion. The seat feels nice so far, hopefully the foam holds up over time. The seat back gives decent support, though I try to not lean back too much. The lumber support piece is adjustable, which is nice, though not sure how much I feel it doing. The recline is also nice, goes back a bit - you aren't going to take a nap in it. The arms adjust for height and have cushioning, can also adjust their width a bit with the mounting bolts. Overall I'm pleased with the chair so far. Will update if it changes over time.

Let's put things into perspective though, this is a $180 couch! I had three expectations when opening the box 1) be a couch 2) be easy to assemble 3) not be broken, that's it! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five, is because one of the legs was broken. However, it was fix-ably broken, just the small plastic end piece on one of the legs. I was able to call the superintendent he helped me superglue it back on and we were good to go. It was mildly inconvenient at worst, still as stated before I expected it to 'not be broken'. For those of you complaining about comfort, quality and/or style; what exactly where you expecting when you typed \"couch\" into the search bar, then selected \"price lowest to highest?\" I was expecting to spend at least $300. For $180 this is amazing! Also, the fact that it can hold up to 500lbs blows my mind, I wouldn't try that, but apparently a few people already have, and it didn't fall apart. In short, I absolutely recommend this couch to anyone who is A) single B) poor or C) both. I do not recommend this to anyone over 6 feet tall who is planing to sleep on it.

I sent a message to Inofia to ask where I could find the cutter in the package and it took 6 hours for them to respond.

It looks pretty good considering that it's imitation woodgrain over particle board. We got two, and the included brackets made it easy to attach them together without drilling or screws. The box was falling apart on one set, but everything inside was OK. The other had a perfect box but had a few dings on the material. Go figure.

It assembles very quickly with clear instructions. I was able to put 2 units together in about 3 hours without another person. I found the pieces to have a very strong smell after opening the box, reminiscent of a carton of cigarettes. The smell has faded but is still not 100% gone. Recommend you air it out if you choose to purchase this product. For the price, you get a good amount of storage. I use this is in a guest room to display photos and house some storage boxes. They are not extremely sturdy however, so be careful storing heavy or breakable items. The kit provides you with a standard metal hex key. The problem is that you're pushing screws into pre-drilled holes and securing it on the back with a nut. The hex key was pretty useless without something to secure the nut. You'll absolutely need an adjustable wrench to be able to tighten it properly. I found that even when properly tightened, the piece doesn't feel 100% sturdy. There's a lot of wobbling around if you apply even a little bit of pressure to the unit since the bamboo is so lightweight. May not be a great idea around kids since this could easily fall over if a kid where to try to climb or pull themselves up with it. This does look a little cheap. The slats for the shelves are glued, and you can easily see the excess glue that wasn't wiped away. I had a few areas with splintered wood, especially around the pre-drilled holes. In some cases, there would be a small finishing nail partially blocking the pre-drilled hole to secure the shelves. One or two spots where the pre-drilled hole doesn't exactly line up properly, preventing you from getting a 100% secure with that shelf. Overall, for the price, I find it's worth it. It's a pretty yellow-toned bamboo but accurate to the product pictures. I think this would look cool painted white. I'd recommend keeping this in a place out of the reach of kids. Would be good in a pantry, basement storage, or garage for small items or lightweight things. Edit: Also want to mention that one of the shelves is branded with the Costway logo. Since my unit is against a wall, I just assembled to make sure that the logo would be against the wall, but keep that in mind if you want this to be used as a room divider and visible from both sides.", "review_title": "Good for the price but you need a wrench", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

Ashley furniture seems to have a decent reputation, and their retail presence suggests to me that they still stand behind their products, to an extent at least. I wanted a long, traditionally puffy and comfortable plush sofa, so I ended up going with this one. The sofa comes well-packaged, but perhaps not well enough to endure mishandling by shippers - luckily there was none in this case. I was surprised initially by how light it is. It's huge, but lighter than its bulk would suggest. This could be a good thing or a bad thing. I will certainly update my review with any added observations on long-term durability. On another durability note, I was not overly pleased with the feet that come with the sofa, and must be installed without predrilled holes. The feet are somewhat light and flimsy plastic, so I am not sure they will hold up over a long time. I'm sure they can be replaced easily, so I'm not overly worried, but I wish they had included better-made and more solid feet. The screws were also extremely hard to drive into the wood base (not joking, I had to put together a lot of pieces with no predrilled holes as part of a recent move, but these four screws were definitely the most difficult to drive!). They have very shallow Phillips heads which easily come loose without applying an absolutely insane amount of pressure. Not a pleasant experience. Now that the moving and setup is over, however, the sofa is a very pleasant piece of the living room! It's the right height, and sufficiently large for plenty of comfortable room for several people. The back and armrests are extremely comfortable. Surprisingly, the cushions are a little less so, as the foam is very, very firm, at least initially. This is probably a good thing, and speaks to better long-term comfort, but you may find them slightly uncomfortable at first. Overall, you get what you pay for, especially with living room furniture. I do believe this is a good choice for the money, and a good value overall. It is a large and comfortable plush sofa that should hold up well over time, and will probably grow more comfortable as the seat cushions break in. My only concerns are with the durability of construction, given the lighter than expected weight, and the flimsiness of the feet. But I expect the worry is unfounded.

Standard box, everything inside is neatly packed and the clean up is amazingly easy, aside from the big ole box that is left, but what else would we expect right? :) Assembly, I followed the instructions and they were pretty straightforward. Bolts come with Loctite(blue agent on the threads that helps the bolt resist being backed out naturally) so the bolts do not need to be super tighted, only hand tightened plus your tightening them through a pretty tough plastic, I was able to hand tighten everything without anything cracking, so the quality of materials used seems decent. Really no issue with assembly if you follow instructions. As for use, I feel this is wear it is slightly lacking. On the positive side the cushions are extremely comfortable, from the arm rests to back, to base. Everything is pretty comfortable and don't feel stiff or rough. I love leaning back in my old computer chair and kicking my feet up on anything I can get a grip on and this chair is definitely great for leaning back and relaxing. What it is lacking in is more so sizing. For instance my personal preference is I wish the arms were extended a little bit further out as it feels like I need to tuck my arms against my side to get any use out of them, not a complete deal breaker though as the arms are comfortable, just not as long as I want. Also the back piece could be a bit taller as it goes to my shoulders, unless I recline, then I can rest my head on the top of the back rest, also not an deal breaker as I am an avid gamer and play most games in a forward focused pose.

It was exactly what I needed for my gaming computer. There were only 2 imperfections. While setting up the desk, the wrench that they gave us had 2 sides to it.

So perhaps if they gave us another wrench with the flat side for the leg bolts would have been useful. Other than that it is really easy to set up. The thing that I did not like is there is a slight chip on the side of the table. It was probably from the seller because the box did not come damaged.

Stool is small and will creak when you sit on it, but feels sturdy once you do. The stool could have been wider and still fit under the counter.

Mirror was a pain to install because it wouldn't stay put, and isn't the right height for me to do my hair, so I don't really use it. Adding lighting to it was too annoying. The top drawers are attached to the mirror via arms in the back and a wooden piece below, which isn't attached to the counter at all so is a slide hazard - there should be a way to latch the piece to the counter for safety. I would have preferred the mirror and top drawers to not be one piece, since I need the drawers more than I need the mirror, I have to disassemble the mirror + arms, which will be bulky to store. The top drawers are pretty small, I would have preferred them to be wider or even meet in the middle for more versatility. The bottom edge of the vanity where your legs will brush is unfinished and will snag whatever you're wearing. Mine was really dusty and I needed to assemble this with a mask on, you'll want to clean the bottom edge and maybe sand it a little to remove the snags. If the stool is too tall, you could use bedpost risers for the vanity itself or some other means of stable elevation.

Came in an approximate 12 inch by 5 foot box. The predrilled holes didnt all align perfectly. Some did, but others didn't. Had to take it apart twice and get a second set of hands to push together to help align the holes a bit better. It took about 3 hours to install (including the redoing twice!) And the wood is more like particle board (as you begin drilling that becomes more noticeable). But now that it is done, i love it!! It gives off a more expensive feel. Great buy for the price. A few notes... 1) It suggests laying on a carpet as you install. That is smart. You can see by my picture that the metal and wood did scratch from the tile floor. *sigh. I should be able to touch it up. 2) Also, they recommend using the foam that packages the product when installing the E and K boards to fill the space between the boards and the floor to prevent bending and possible breakage. I will tell you this, it helped with the power drill, having those boards level. So that was also a good suggestion in the instructions. 3)The stickers that labeled the boards (almost all boards have a sticker) peel off effortlessly. I wouldve given it 5 stars had the install been a little smoother. I really recommend 2 people.... 1 screwing and 1 pushing boards as tightly as possible together to line up. 4) Also, flashlight is probably needed. We used one to make sure holes were lines up. I do recommend this if you are looking for an affordable, higher end looking headboard. It does the trick! (Once you get past the install!)", "review_title": "Good buy!

The problem is that the padding isn't thick enough on the bottom side and since everything else in the box is rigid, the wood was being damaged through the padded sleeves. And, just to add insult to injury, since they package the wood pieces front side down, that's the only side that gets damaged; the back sides are unblemished. There were still scratches and nicks in the second set, but they were in better shape than the first ones, so I swapped those out and will return the second unit with the first set of wood pieces.

The Box weighs about 90 lb so if your frail or small make certain to have someone to help you move the box where it needs to be.

The only downside was my fault as I was using the incorrect screws because two sets of screws have same height and looked similar in the manual. Please note that the screws are different widths. Don't waste time like I did LOL use the manual and follow it to a T. Even with my mess up it still came out great. You would definitely need two people to help hold pieces in place while you screw in and use the allen key to secure. Some pieces will require you to keep the screws loose so don't fully tighten until you're certain you're done with that part. Other than that the bed is super sturdy and it will take you a couple of hours to assemble with help, maybe 3 without help. Also if you are trying to fit a desk under here you won't be able to as it's very low. I'm 5'4 and had to stoop half my height to get under the bed. Anywho buy this you won't regret it.

Materials are high quality and the assembly is easy and straight forward if you've ever put a chair together before. One complaint I've seen is that the arm rest are too firm. Unless you consistently keep the points of your elbows on the armrest they are fine. The lumbar support is a great feature to have and more chairs should include this. The seat does use firm foam but if you are sitting for extended periods of time this is something you will come to appreciate. It does break in slightly over time but don't expect it to be a night and day difference from day 1. Overall I expect this will be a chair that holds up very well and will last. The included pillows are a nice feature, I find myself using the headrest pillow on a regular basis. The lumbar pillow though I only use when reclining to help fill the gap at the base of my back. While reclining I should add that the chair is solid and I've never felt like it was going to tip over. The ability to lock the tilt mechanism while tilted back in something I wish my other chairs would've had. One thing I hope that is changed in future iterations would be the ability to move the built in lumbar support higher or lower depending on your height. I'm 6'2 200lbs and the chairs fits perfectly but I can see how a taller or shorter person might have issues with the lumbar location. Lastly I did switch out the wheels for larger roller blade style wheel to allow the chair to roll easier on carpet. The included casters are nice and higher quality than most but will still struggle to roll on thicker carpet. I thought I was going to regret spending over $400 on a gaming chair but I wish I would've bought this chair a long time ago, could've saved my fell some back ache.", "review_title": "Great support & comfort but give it time", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

My favorite part about this is the place to put my external keyboards. I think it would be really difficult to use this without some sort of a keyboard separate from your laptop.... I have pretty much sedentary work life (graphic design/video editing), so this is really great way to get me off my feet during the day!

This is a beautiful cart/stand, and it's exactly what I wanted. But - there are no instructions - only pictures. I can usually put things together (by myself) without even looking at the pictures, but this has so many pieces, that look alike, that we were constantly looking at the photo and trying to figure out the difference in the pieces. Some things were very obvious. Other things more confusing than you might imagine. I gave it 4 stars because it is beautiful, and it is exactly what I wanted. I'm hoping the problem with my unit was just a fluke, and that most units are perfect after assembly. But it took two people, over two hours, to put it together. On top of that, the roller tracks for the drawer, were not installed straight, and the screws (already installed prior to shipping) were half in, so the drawer wouldn't go into the track. We had to grind down the heads on the screws and straighten the side that was crooked, and the drawer still doesn't open easily. I can't just reach down and open the drawer to get a file. It takes both hands to get the drawer out. I'm honestly not sure I'll be able to use the drawer. At this price, I expected it to be perfect. I am honestly disappointed, because it is exactly what I wanted - if only it was functional. It fits both my printers, and it would eliminate the file cabinet I've been using, so you get so much function in a small space. I wish it worked like it was supposed to. I can't even think of returning it. Not going to take it apart to ship and return, after all this work. I think it's worth the chance - and hope you have better luck.

Rugs go sliding across the room -- even the one that is held down by a couple of sofa legs, doesn't stand a chance.

I cut the two pads (easily) to size and waited for a play-night -- that night they went to town. :-) After 20 minutes of hard play - they zonked off to sleep -- and not a rug had budged - even the one that did not have any furniture on it!!
