Benchy stress testing would get through most of the difficult paces, but arches would fail and the entire print would slip free from the bed.

It has a \"front\" and back, so if you're particular, be sure to look for the brand name and put it where you want it. It is a good height for working under normal conditions (food prep, etc.). However, our countertop grill is 8\" tall, making the surface a little high for true comfort. The legs would be fairly easy to shorten with a metal cutting blade and a lot of elbow grease, but it would need to be done BEFORE assembly. Cut the TOPS of the legs, which fit into sleeves on the table top. Then assemble the shelf, and the adjustable feet can be leveled as necessary once you get it in place.

These casters do NOT have t-nuts. They do have nuts attached, presumably to tighten the caster once screwed into the leg. T-nuts provide a layer of integrity to each leg so the casters don't chew up the wood inside the leg with repeated movement. Ergo, I will be buying the t-nuts to prolong the life of the legs of the side table I am putting these casters on. Casters are the right size and made well enough for my purposes.

From what I have read, this is extremely common during shipment as they would not be kept vertical. H-B's website has a video that shows you how to use a flame (I used a common lighter) to move the liquid into the upper bulb (be careful not to fill it as it could break the glass), at which point the air bubble easily disappeared for me. I used an oven mitt to hold the thermometer. It took all of 1 minute. If the gap was towards the bottom, then maybe dry ice is necessary? Mine was towards the top. I suppose the only way around this issue is to not order from Amazon, but in a brick and mortar store so you can inspect for gaps and where they probably kept it vertical at all times and probably removed any gap themselves before putting it on the shelves. Tho it does include a pretty case, the plastic container it was shipped in seems fine as a holder for the thermometer and that is what I am using. The folded instructions are still inside, but I see no need to remove them.

I bought it for camping and some small backyard tree trimming projects. This thing outperforms even my wildest dreams. For comparison, I was using a 12\" gas powered chainsaw that was an entry level saw. It worked pretty good, but adjusting the chain was a nightmare, it leaked oil and it just didn't cut consistently enough for me to bother using. It was more hassle maintaining it that it was using it. So, I upgraded to this beast of a tool. First off, the battery life on this thing is way better than I could have imagined. I charged it to full and was able to cut 30-40 small (3\" or less) limbs off my trees in the backyard. It was still at full battery after these branches were trimmed. I then brought it camping and used it to cut firewood and it was still at 3 bars (full battery) when I got home. I still have not charged it a second time and have used it a handful of times in the yard. It is still showing 3 full bars of battery life. Well beyond my expectations. The saw is quiet, stops almost instantly when you let off the trigger and it's a variable speed trigger so you can control exactly how fast you want to chain to move. The only gripe I have with this chainsaw is that it leaks oil. I saw this as a common issue people were reporting and while some seem to not see this issue, I definitely did. I now store it vertically using the inset hole in the handle and my oil leaks seem to have stopped. It's just strange that if you store it horizontally, it would leak so profusely.
