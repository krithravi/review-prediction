The little Stone comes out of these and customers are complaining and bringing them back and we are having to put new jewelry in their holes. You cannot sterilize these in an autoclave as well because it heats up too much and the glue does not hold up so the second group of these that we used I did not sterilize them that way and the stones still came out. When I use a dermal clamp to put the top on the stones come out immediately.

The bail used on the cross is more substantial than the rest of the cross in terms of thickness and weight. There's cardboard thicker than this cross. It appears that it will get bent easily. I worry that the bail will snap the pendant-loop because the loop is severely thin. Use caution on this fragile piece. AUTHENTICITY: No 10k gold stamp found. No certification cards included in the shipment. I will bring this piece to a jeweler to verify.... Otherwise, this cross only reminds me of costume jewelry. DELIVERY: Arrived fast! However, shipping label does say Claddagh Gold and there are instructions to leave it if no response, making it an easy target for someone to steal it!!!! Luckily, the carrier put it in the mailbox, but the label saying the shipper's name does not help. In past experience, things worth of value require signatures. PRICE: Not worth $50.

I've had things not work out, and I've had things be less than expected, but this bracelet.

The page advertises a buckle closure to make it adjustable, this is a flat out lie as the bracelet comes with snap buttons. Surprisingly it managed to fit quite comfortably around my wrist, but when I went to remove it the snap sheared away so the bracelet was essentially one use. Really the only good thing that came from this purchase is the fact that I can hold the bracelet in my hands, take measurements, look at the details, and just make my own.

I still love the ring design and price point. However, as I noted in my original review, I have bad metal allergies. This is not pure stainless steel. I have other stainless steel jewelry that I can wear for days on end with no issues. I wore this ring several days in a row, removing it at night, and I began breaking out from where the metal was in contact with my finger. I'm not sure if it is the antiquing or if the steel is plated to make it a shinier silver. Whatever it is, it is definitely not pure stainless steel. Such a shame. At least I can wear this once in a while when I need a nicer looking ring. I have bad metal allergies and can only safely wear a few metals, making jewelry nearly impossible to find. Stainless steel is one of my few safe metals, so I have been searching for more right hand rings in steel. I decided to try this ring as I love roses and this fit my simplistic style well. I just got it tonight and love it. I ordered a 7, and it is a perfect fit. It has a low profile to my finger. I wear it with the vine to the top of my hand, and even still it goes almost from my middle joint to my top knuckle. It stays put well and doesn't slide around. And it has a very solid feel to it. It does not look like a $10 ring at all, but it was worth the price.", "review_title": "Cheap but great quality", "language": "en", "product_category": "jewelry"}

Delivered on time, nicely wrapped, in a pretty bag, inside a box. They were broken, which always a bonus when ordering jewelry from Amazon. They\u2019re pretty off your ears. They color is nice and they\u2019re not cheap looking or poor quality (at least the flower isn\u2019t, but the hook might be). Heavy materials if you like heavy hanging on your ear. CONS: The hook (for your ears was backwards), I had to fix them. No big deal though. They\u2019re very heavy for my ears, and that made metal hook instantly irritate my lobe. Once on, they hang strange, it\u2019s not a natural dangle at all... they\u2019re just clumpy looking on and the weight makes them both look and feel awkward.

There are small breaks at two different sections of the opal where the enamel or sticker separates. Overall it does not impact the look, you can only tell if you look closely, but just something to be aware of.

The screws that fasten the bracelet work well, and I was able to put it on myself with no trouble. The only thing I worried about was which size to order. My wrists measure about 6 1/2\" around, however I personally prefer bangle style bracelets to be a bit looser than link style bracelets, so I ordered the 7\" bracelet and it fits exactly how I like it, just a little room to spare and move around my wrist a bit. The places on the inside of the bracelet where the screws are do not bother me at all. I wear it next to my steel watch and it looks fabulous!

I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it!
