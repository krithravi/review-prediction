The multitude of interior pockets are unnecessary and just added weight if you use a wallet with the backpack. The external water bottle pocket is useless if your are right handed.

The first time I used it with my Thermos water bottle, it dropped out and dented the bottle and broke the lid, so it was not available for the rest of the trip. Even plastic disposable water bottles fell out. The bag either needs water bottle holders on both sides so that at least one is usable, or better yet, an elastic anchor strap to securely hold water bottle in place.

I personally feel this pouch is pretty useless in that regard. Not only it's bulky --- nowhere near \"invisible\" under the clothing as advertised --- the major flaws: 1) The zipper compartments are SIDEWAY, with the locked position at the top of the zipper. This makes no sense to me, because if the zipper lock shifted down (or any pickpocket zip it down), everything in the side compartment would fell off 2) There is no horizontal zipping compartment. An horizontal zipper compartment would makes things less likely falling out. 3) The biggest compartments (back of the pouch) uses velcro. This is 21st Century, hello??? It does not make any retrieval of items any easier. I also happened to have Zero Grid (I am not affiliated) which addresses most of the issues above. The plus with Zero Grid: a) Two horizontal zipping compartments, one of them large enough to hold an iPhone XR (but not anything bigger, that's a minus vs this Venture pouch) b) Zero Grid has the belt bands but this Venture does not .... If you intent to use it around your pant, Zero Grid is the way to go. c) Zero Grid comes with stickers for lost item retrieval (free sign up) ... I stick them onto the back of my family's four passports for peace of mind. It also comes with like $250 lost/stolen guarantee. d) Zero Grid uses double strip --- harder to break (but not sure if it's cut resistant). The Venture is single and also does not appear to be cut resistant. Nevertheless, two is better than one.", "review_title": "Not secure", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

She wanted it mainly for the harness and leash. Unfortunately because of the way the straps are designed it doesn\u2019t work all that well for that part. The chest buckle is way too low which I didn\u2019t notice when I was ordering it. If you were to actually try to use this on a child as a harness it\u2019s not very secure and slips way up if they\u2019re tugging on it at all. It would have been much better if the chest strap had been adjustable up and down. One idea I had was adding a strap all the way across that attaches to the pack instead of the shoulder pads and comes across under his armpits. But that\u2019s a lot of work to make it useable. It\u2019s possible maybe he\u2019ll grow into it a little better eventually but that doesn\u2019t really help me now. It really is cute on him though so if you don\u2019t care about the harness it might be worth getting. One other negative is the adjustable part on the shoulder pads isn\u2019t hemmed, so when you loosen it, it can come all the way out and you have to rethread it. It\u2019s a pretty easy fix to just fold over the fabric and sew it, but it\u2019s something that should have already been done.", "review_title": "Ok as a backpack, not that great as a leash", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

Love that there isn't a ton of wacky colors or huge noticeable logos. It was a great quality bag, not cheaply made. Sturdy zipper and clips to secure the zippers. The only big problem is the straps. They are really nicely designed, the way you shorten/elongate the straps goes up through the straps up by your shoulders instead of down by your waist, so you pull by your shoulders to make it shorter. The BIG PROBLEM is the straps are exceptionally long and made it unusable. I'm a 5'7\" female and at the very shortest it was hanging on my bum. You can't even force the rest of the strap up through the plastic holder because the seam is too fat to go though. There is a waist strap but that would just awkwardly hold the bag at the waist while the top pulls away. If the straps fit or could be adjusted I would have kept it for sure.

If you are looking for a disposable set of luggage, this is it. The quality is equivalent to what's offered at your local discount store. The wheels are all plastic. The extended handle flexes a lot and the release button is sensitive so that the handle keeps retracting while you're wheeling through the airport. I've used the smaller bag as a carry on for a very short trip and it's already nicely scratched and dinged from a fall on the pavement. My guess is that rough handling by baggage check will likely be enough to break this set. On the positive side, the amount of storage is nice and the smaller bag held a weekend worth of clothes nicely with space to spare. The bag also fit well into the overhead compartment, but note that the smaller bag has no side handle - which I missed when lifting and lowering the bag.

There are four wheels on the bottom that spin 360 degrees which is great for maneuverability. When you open it, the storage space is half on one side of the shell & half on the other, with a zippered flap to keep each side separated. I packed a week's worth of stuff in mine for a road trip (clothes, toiletries, makeup, blowdryer, flat iron, curling iron, and sandals), and it fit everything & still wasn't too heavy. I haven't flown with it yet, but will be using it as a carryon for a plane trip in a few months and will update my review then. So far, it is an awesome piece of luggage for a low price, and the only con I can think of is when the telescoping handle is at its most extended height it feels a bit wobbly, but not like it's going to snap or anything, just a tad wiggly.

It did work out though as I ended up falling more in love with some colors unexpectedly. While I am super happy with mine, product quality is inconsistent so I ordered 2 sets and settled on keeping 1 and returning the other. Some of the zippers were sewn in lopsided or fabric had wierd scrunching. pros- Smaller than expected and fits my needs better Cool little details like the lettered fabric piece, small front pocket, liner, and different fabrics Cute patterns Comes with decent keychain, but is removable from loop to make it more versatile Looks like a real backpack Decent zipper Holds a decent amount of small items for safe keeping cons- Wish I could pick styles and buy individual ones since I don't need all 4 (a pro though would be that I can give them away as a cute add on gift). Front pocket doesnt have much use and is more decorative, but is sewn so it can still be opened which is confusing. Back is not patterned and plain fabric (a pro is it still matches though) Inconsistent quality", "review_title": "Really cute", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

It should be noted here that I always travel with a down throw which takes up the same amount of space as one or maybe even two outfits. The side of the bag with the outside pocket must not be over-packed if you want to carry your laptop in that pocket without the chance of damage. It is not the type of suitcase that is easy to \"live\" out of due to the nature of hardside cases where the zipper splits the case in the middle. Which means that you need a large surface to open the case flat. (Usually, the floor) Take that into consideration when deciding between hard or soft side luggage.
