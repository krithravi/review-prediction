Using the monitor stands... they were about 5 inches off the ground. - I'm not one to return things... but honestly... like many of you, I too have ordered so many things off AMAZON, that his is my first EVER bad experience with a product that I felt was not properly advertised.

HP admits this. It is set by default to print two sided. If you can remember, each time you go to print you can uncheck the \"two sided\" box, but who remembers to do this. Tech support says you can't change a default setting to not print two sided automatically or \"scan to computer\" (from the printer) if you have a Mac. So you have to walk to the printer, load your scan pages, walk back to you Mac to tell it to scan, back to the printer to retrieve you original documents etc. The scan quality is not very clear. My old HP had clearing scans. This is crazy to understand since so many people have Macs. Also, the document feeder recently jams, so be very careful using the document feeder if you have important documents that you don't want to risk getting chewed up.

Then it started not cutting at all. I was able to get a hold of the chat customer service, which was really helpful but made me jump through a lot of hoops (like recording my machine failing to cut when all the settings were right). It's a good thing I had the day off because it took forever to figure it out but they agreed to send me a new machine. I had to pay to ship the defective machine back though (WHY?). I got the new machine and I was so happy to finally be doing work with a machine that was not defective expect just a few days later the new machine started having the same issues! The auto-blade will not adjust the blade correctly and it will get stuck at 0 and not cut. The workaround I found was to set the blade manually and change the auto-blade settings to ratchet blade. After all, I'm only cutting stickers, I don't need the blade settings to constantly change. Well... now the new machine is not registering the registration marks even though they are black marks on white sticker paper! And sometimes it registers them but the cuts are completely off.

However, with the two trays I can put envelopes in one and normal copy paper in the other and it will work fine. However, when I use cardstock and normal copy paper, the printer cannot distinguish between the two and the software won't let you pick which tray to print from.

But there is NO WAY TO TAKE APART ANY OF THE PIECES. You can't separate the overflow tray, you can't lift the lid entirely off, you cant take out the whole sorter to remove the jam. I had coins going down into the power supply area, coins jammed in places you couldn't reach, I ended up having to take the whole thing upside down and shaking it until most of the coins fell out, then I had to detach the back panel which, again, DOESN\"T detach all the way and fish around for all the coins that fell back there.

I'm sorry, but that's just wrong. My review was unbiased and honest, and I will not remove or change it. Beware this seller's questionable business practices! ORIGINAL REVIEW: This product did not meet our needs and is being returned. It does not hold \"banker boxes\" my attorney-husband uses regularly for work despite the dimensions given. Also, the handle is unstable. Interestingly enough, we received an email two days after our order arrived advising us that \"some customers\" have problems with the instability of the handle and suggesting we watch an updated You Tube video the seller has created to address this issue. We were assured that the cart \"can still be used\" despite the wonky handle, and were asked if we still wanted to keep it. This is before I ever issued a return/refund request. Apparently, this is a well-known issue with the product that has caused many customers to return it. I would have liked to have known this ~before~ I ordered it, especially since it was a gift. I know it's a weird gift, but hey, it's what my husband asked for. Then again, if I had known about the problem, I probably wouldn't have purchased the cart at all, which I'm sure is why the problem isn't disclosed upfront. Needless to say, it is being returned. Between the size and the problems with the handle, we're just going to go with another brand altogether. His current one is from Magna Cart and he loves it. It needs to be replaced because he accidentally damaged the cart, not because of a defect with the cart. I'd recommend that brand over this one. Two stars because someone carrying smaller items who doesn't mind a brand new cart with handle issues might find it useful. Us, not so much.", "review_title": "Had to be returned.

This is not entirely true, you just have to have an extra allen wrench to counter-spin one side of the bolt while you tighten the other. While I was able to tighten it enough to use, I couldn't ever find a position for it that felt natural or useful for me. By far the worst part of the chair was the seat pad. Not nearly enough cushion for me. I'm 6'3\" and weigh about 215, so it may feel better for others that aren't as big. But for me, it felt like I was sitting on a metal plate after about 20-30 minutes. Having gone through several chairs in my time, I know the padding on these wears thin after sitting on them for 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

So, skinny, but within the mainstream when it comes to body size. And this chair is terrible. I'll start with the worst part: the lumbar support. I have to wonder if the reviewers who spoke positively about spent any time sitting in the chair. It's hard and not near tapered enough, meaning it basically stabs me in the back as I sit. There's no way to disable the lumbar support -- even if I retract it all the way, it still pokes me. The adjustable height lets me choose exactly where I'll hurt later, but there's no comfortable spot and no way to remove the support altogether. The armrests are another problem. The ergonomic recommendations are to have the armrests support your elbows when they're loose at your sides. For me, the armrests don't go low enough -- that is, even the lowest armrest position still forces me to hunch my shoulders. While I paid for the 3D armrests, that was a waste of money. If I try to tilt them inward to comfortably use a keyboard, it makes the back of the armrests so far apart that my elbows can no longer hit them. Perhaps this chair is really great for someone much larger than I am.

Those two features ROCK and you cannot deny them. 2. The problem is, and it's no small problem, the quality is very poor, even when you tighten up the sharpness with the slider on the side of the projector. Reading text is almost impossible unless you zoom in a-lot. I'm a salesman and purchased this for convenient presentations on the road but when I'm demoing our software prospects find it hard to read what I'm showing them. I have to zoom in a lot when I'm demoing and make the text in PowerPoints very large. 3. Another downside, and this may be unavoidable due to the size, is that it's only 1000 lumens so the room has to be pretty dark or the projector has to be very close to the wall or screen you're projecting onto (which limits the size of the projection). This limits the portability and flexibility of the projector...which is the main reason I bought this thing. 4. I tried to use it at home to watch movies and my wife asked me to turn it off after 10 minutes because the quality and lighting was so bad. I agreed with her. I was looking forward to using this on the weekend for a movie theatre experience but unfortunately we can't use it this way. 5. The menu options are mostly in Chinese with some english, I couldn't find a way to adjust the language setting to be all english. 6. If the company has another projector that fixes the issues mentioned above I'd be willing to swap this one out to try the other one and update the review.", "review_title": "Very Convenient, Very Poor Quality", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

Sound volume from the speakers is OK for a small room, when placed near the upper end of the volume. It is totally inadequate for a larger conference room use. With the bluetooth, even with the phone a foot away from the M2 the results have been mixed. A few times the calls had a lot of crackling. You have to turn the volume to the max to be able to hear the instructions for joining the conference. Once on the conference, the microphone pickup is good -- the people on the other end were not able to tell the difference between the microphone on the M2 vs the microphone on the Galaxy S8. However the speaker volume even on max is not much better than the speaker volume on the Galaxy S8. It may be a little clearer. I may try to attach an auxiliary speaker system and try that out.

There's a perforated 2mm border all the way around the outside of the sheet that separates up the middle between labels. If you peel it from the wrong angle, it peels up parts of that thin border which will stick to you, the label, and anything else while you're trying to wrangle it off. 3. If you print one label and then need to put it back for a future printing session, if there is ANY of that thin border still on the page, it can get caught in your paper feed. If you have to save a sheet for single printing later - remove the border. 4. about 1 in 5 sheets is not completely perforated so when you peel a label off, it tears the label and you have to wrestle it off.

There's a slight gap between the grey protected corner. Other than that, the inside compartments are large enough to hold a couple erasers in one and paper clips in other.

I bought my fifth one from Amazon in September 2018, and now, in December 2018, it has inexplicably gone from working just fine to sounding muffled like everything was recorded from beneath a pillow. The recorder was not damaged in any way. I am quite familiar with the settings, having now owned five of these, and I double, triple, and quadruple checked that the mic setting didn't get changed. No. The recorder just fizzled out after two months. I purchased this through Amazon Prime's fulfillment center, and it seems that their quality checks aren't what they used to be when they first started, as many counterfeit and outlet quality items are being sold as originals.

I've seen other reviews on Arteza products that were very favorable. However, I feel disappointed. I have used these in two different high quality adult coloring books. A Johanna Basford and a Leila Duly book. Both of these books have very small spaces that requires precision. These are listed as pens, but in my opinion they are more like a fine line marker. The cons: some of the pens are very dry, so that they scratch and skip over the paper which results in patchy looking coloration. The Caps and stoppers at the bottom of each pen appear to be color coded. However, the pen color is drastically different from the color indicators. I included a picture of some swatches I did for the greens. Colors G6 to GO are just Small example, but most of the pen caps do not match the ink color The dryer pens are impossible to blend or build color. Also, if one runs out of ink I don't see a reliable way to replace it, none of the pens have a color name or code. And I haven't seen a listing for individual pens. Pros: the ones that are on the wetter side will blend beautifully with practice and skill. I'm not that skilled, but I was able to get a couple of nice blends. The case they come in is a sturdy and a good travel size.

I was having trouble finding the 5x8 spiral index cards I use to write down recipes and ran across this journal. I selected this size because it's roughly that of the index cards I like. PROS: It has the hard front and back covers & this helps a lot since I use these in the kitchen for recipes The paper is really good quality and holds up under even a semi-thick marker that I used on one page The papers are nicely spiraled and don't stick together at the inner edges the way some cheap notebooks will Even though the pad holds 140 pages, it's not too thick; I can write down to the very end/edge with comfort CONS: The cover was hard to write on in regular ballpoint; it is thick and the pen doesn't roll over it easily. I ended up using a marker instead. I know that the price seems a little bit high in some people's opinion, but I have paid as much for the index cards. The quality of this little journal makes it worth it. This size is going to fit nicely in the cupboard with my other recipe notes and books.

My criticism of the Rocketbook is that scanning from the iPhone app isn't so easy. It will literally take 30-60 seconds for the app to register the note and then scan it. It is very important to have good lighting, but even with good lighting it isn't a simple snap of your camera. for the 30-60 seconds (and it is closer to 60 seconds if not more), you need to keep steady but at the same time move the phone ever so slightly until the app detects the note. It is a little bit of a hassle and not quick or easy. The rest of the stuff is good. I opened multiple folders on my cloud service- one for important #'s, one for file notes, one for personal notes, etc, and you can designate which folder you want a note to scan to. I love that.

I have a really nice stand in my office but it is a bit bulky so I liked this slim design. Shortly after I received it I realized this was not going to work for me for several reasons. 1) the pieces that hold your laptop on the stand at the bottom are poorly designed. They dig into your wrists as you type making it impossible to use your keyboard correctly. I had to purchase a separate wireless keyboard. 2) issue with these same pieces. They randomly pop off, I've almost lost them several times and finally this morning it popped off and I can not find one of them. This makes my computer lopsided and unsecure on the stand. I was willing to overlook the fact that the height wasn't adjustable but these other two design flaws make this completely not worth it for me and I wish I would have spent the extra money and gotten an identical stand to the one I have in my office. UPDATE: I will say that my original opinion stands true that this stand is not compatible with the way I type. As I stated above, I was able to fix it by adding a keyboard and mouse so I'm not actually using it to type on but just a stand. The customer service however was very good which is why I will increase the stars. They did send me a new stand since mine was broken and missing the bottom piece.

The pens write fairly well, color chart shows both sets. It is hard to get a good picture of the glitter tones, but they are all indeed greenish or brownish, some are just so glittery that they read as silver in the picture. Strangely, the green tones set has numbered refills that match the numbered refills in the pens, but the earth tones set has no numbering at all. The cases are really crappy, the one case split open and the pens fell out just from the slight pressure of putting the pen back into the case. For me, this is not really an issue, I rarely keep gel pens in the case they come in, but mentioning this for those who do. If all you want are green and earth tones, then I guess this might be worth paying the higher cost to get only those colors. Honestly though, all of the colors can be found in any number of other sets that are only slightly more expensive and which have as many as 100 other colors to boot. I can't recommend these sets because of that. Just makes no sense to pay a lot for 24 colors when you can add another 5 to 10 bucks, get all of the 24 colors in one of these sets plus 100 more.

The wood doesn\u2019t seem well finished in general. It\u2019s kind of scratchy. It looks nice, and these are I guess nitpicky things. It seems kind of like there was no quality control. It was packaged well, and there was no way the corners could have been damaged like this in shipping. About the letters: the gold ones are a bit browner than I expected. It\u2019s fine, but I was expecting them to be more cheery. You do have to cut the words out which was a bit confusing to me as all the regular letters came precut. It\u2019s fine. I was happy to only have to cut out a few things. It was just odd. Another odd thing is that it came with one drawstring bag for the letters. There\u2019s no way all of them would fit in that one bag and stay separated, so it\u2019s confusing as to why they bothered to include one at all if they weren\u2019t going to provide enough for each separate color/type. One last thing: It fits a bit too snug in the stand, and it almost seems like I\u2019m scratching it when I put it in there. It fits the best on the two sides that the lines are going vertically on (so the words would be sideways when I put it in there like that) which is not what we\u2019re going for. I know these are small things, but they detracted from my overall experience. Knowing this, I wouldn\u2019t give this as a gift, nor was I planning to. I bought it for myself which is why I\u2019m willing to overlook these things and keep it. I wanted a functional, double sided letter board, and that\u2019s what I got.

Unfortunately, of the 4 FPs I currently own, the Preppy is my least favorite. I like the line width. But, at the same time it seems \"scratchier\" than pens of comparable Nib sizes. That, and I seem to get more hard starts and skips with the Preppy than any other pen; by a considerable margin. In short, it's not a bad pen. It's just not as enjoyable to write with as the other FPs I've tried. I did recently purchase some bottled ink, so I'll reserve full judgment until I do a complete flush and refill. I figure using the same ink in all the pens is the best way to compare apples to apples. And, it's entirely possible the ink that came with the Preppy was the weak link. One note about the included ink. Or more precisely, the poor packaging. The whole thing came smashed, and all the ink cartridges (save for one) had exploded inside the package. It was a royal mess, and I nearly just tossed the whole thing altogether. But, I took some time to clean everything up, and was happy to find one salvageable cartridge.

I've used many different daily, monthly planner brands over the years and this one is the most interesting one by far. Pros: This is an unusual structure in how it's forces the user to plan, review, and reinforce/amend behavior techniques to accomplish overall goals. It also allows a creative aspect to spark the user's imagination. I like the bold colors and the three, practical bookmarks. Nice sturdy cover. Cons: As previous reviewers have mentioned, it takes some time to write out all of the dates, goals, and ideas. Also, the ribbons are already starting to fray, and there's a slight lean in the binding (possibly due to leaving the back pocket empty?). This is from using for almost 4 weeks.

Make the base a bit heavier...sometimes it likes to move around while trying to mount something in the helping hands. 4. Include a sponge for the metal tray that can be used when soldering if needed.

The cotter pin is the funny looking skinny thing. Only three of my \"caps\" fit, but as long as you have twisted those cotter pins (you need a pair of needle nose pliers to separate the small part from the big part) and then twist them around in different directions to lock the wheel in place - do this to all four cotter pins. Hope this helps. I find that when it is folding, the little wheels sort of get in the way. They have to be facing back toward the big wheels and then it will fold easily. Just experiment a little.

We've got a spare room that is about 3 meters from the back wall to the other side, and I projected the image on the white wall. This produced a picture that was a little under 2 by 3 meters in size, almost covering the whole wall. With heavy curtains the room got pretty dark, and the image quality was good. Text was readable as well. This is not a projector for lit rooms, its lamp is too weak in that regard. On the plus side, I connected my ChromeCast to the HDMI-port and powered it from the built in USB-port, and that way it is very easy to set up - just one power cord and the rest is wireless. I connected my JBL Xtreme bluetooth-speaker using a mini-jack cable, and this made the movie experience really good, even though the built in speaker is good enough. I watched an action movie and was immersed in the action with the huge picture and good sound quality from the JBL. I also played some Minecraft with my daughter through our old Playstation 3, and this was just as enjoyable as film. If you are sitting in a quiet room the fan is pretty noisy, but when the movie is on it is less noticeable. I would recommend sitting at a distance from the unit itself though, if you can. All in all, very satisfied with the purchase. For the price it is good, and it suits my needs perfectly as a portable device that is easy to use, quick to set up and small enough to put in a bag or backpack. Living in Europe with 220V outlet it is also good to know that the projector handles both 110 and 220 V, I just swapped out the supplied cable that has US-plug with a european plug I had laying around, no worries there.", "review_title": "Good value, works fine in a dark room", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

Function: It writes very consistently and it's weight allows it to be used for longer periods of time. I've also not had any skips or similar issues. The only minor negative thing I have to say is that it's scratchier on cheaper paper (e.g. run of the mill printer type) than the other fountain pens I have at this price point. On decent quality paper, it writes quite smoothly. The cap posts well while not added that much additional weight as to throw off the writing experience. It also still yields a satisfying \"click\" when protecting the nib. I used it every day at work before acquiring more pens and colors, though I am working it back into my weekly rotation. Accessories: The converter is a bladder type which is atypical at this price point. I've not had any issues with it leaking or anything. Its inclusion with the purchase of the pen is nice.

The legs lock open but they don't lock closed. So when you pick up the tray the legs can fall open. 2. The small drawer tends to easily slide open whenever the tray is tilted towards that end and thing can fall out. 3. Adjusting the leg height requires loosening and tightening four plastic nuts.

First: A note to people who complain that they dropped them and they broke. Yes, and so do eggs. Do you give eggs a thumbs down, or one star for breaking when you drop them? Just curious.

Your fingers don't turn black (nor does the cat get black streaks when he gets pet without thinking about the state of your pinkies) If it has a pretty sharp point, you can use it until the point is flat on one side, but still sharp, so by rotating it, you can get wider or very fine marks. I love that. They will break if you drop them, but I find them satisfactorily robust unless it rolls off my desk, which happened. They are round after all.... As some have mentioned, there is very little difference between the 3 grades, but they are all fine with me. And as far as I'm concerned, they are as black as most of the other options I have experimented with, so I'm happy. The one downside is that it is not black black. It's dark, blackish, but not soft-compressed, or vine black. But I'm happy to practice/learn with these, and splash a little real black on when needed. I may stop using them when I am much more experienced, but for now, they are a good compromise for me.

The 2 x 4 inch size is more than big enough to include a lot of information on the label. The things I don't like are the cost, however, on amazon they are much cheaper than the box stores.

The built-in microphones record in stereo, and if you have no need to record in stereo using an external microphone and have no desire to use it to make recordings from devices with their own powered output then it is a perfectly good device and a good value for the money.", "review_title": "Nice device but returned it for one with more advanced features", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

I finally decided to get this set because it was very affordable and it had many good reviews. I am so happy to say that I was able to use these paints successfully without any of the colors mudding up. They are a thick consistency similar to some acrylics, and they also dry really fast (faster than some acrylic paints which was unexpected for me to discover). But the very cool thing is that you can reactivate gouache with water, which was why I was afraid that the colors would muddy together, but they did not! They don't react to water like watercolor paint does. I definitely recommend any acrylic or watercolor painter or anyone to invest in this set if you want to try gouache out without spending too much money, it's a very interesting and fun medium to paint with. One thing I didn't like however was that the color of the paint from this brand was not accurate. It's one color when it's wet, but once dry it tends to be one or two shades darker or lighter, which really bothered me but one can get used to. Note- You can't do light washes with these since they are water-based.", "review_title": "interesting mix between acrylic and watercolor paints!", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

This has happened twice to me. I'm on my third Graph Gear 1000. I put up with what I consider a design flaw in the pencil because I do like the \"feel\" of the pencil. I'm very careful now about trying to avoid dropping the pencil. For the expense of the pencil - it is more expensive than your typical mechanical pencil, it seems to me this \"plastic sleeve\" in the barrel could be either better designed, or made of metal. One feature of the pencil I really like is that the clutch that holds the graphite in place allows the graphite to be placed back into the pencil.

However this is one of my favorite purchases. Everything works perfectly for several months thus far. The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access \"key slot\" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe.", "review_title": "Best Safe Under $100", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

I have a 125lb Rottweiler who lives indoors, but when he goes outside he likes to patrol the fence and sometimes likes to do the annoyance bark (at airplanes, a leaf blowing by, a dog barking in the distance, etc.) so I put this on him when he goes outside for extended periods (probably 2-3 times a week for a total of 2-3 hours).

If I have only 1 major complaint about it, though, is that it can be difficult to write on the left-hand pages sometimes. It's quite thick of a planner, so that means the left-hand pages droop down without support, and you don't have as solid of a surface to write on unless something is placed beneath them. Fortunately, though, the lid of the box it comes in works pretty well that, but it's just a bit annoying to work around/with. Still, it's nothing that should stop you from buying the planner yourself. =) For note, I've only had it a couple of weeks, so I don't know yet of it's long-term durability and strength.

The initial downside to the product is a short power cable. I attempted to find the same cord by Vankyo but extended. Unfortunately, at first look, I was unable to find what I needed. I suggest an extension cable as a result. The plug is not grounded therefore it fits in small places like a power strip. The product's fan can be loud depending on your viewing, but the sound quality produced by the speakers does well to cover up the ambience. With a quick set up, I was able to get a fair quality picture though the text of the Chrome tabs was difficult to read from the display. Zooming in on the projecting device, like a computer, can aid this. The remote is very helpful and even has a slight glow to it, but it is not backlit so you need some light, even the light of the projector, to first navigate the buttons. I projected from approximately 8ft, and did notice the grid lines made by what I assume are the pixels. this results in a less smooth image, but does little to interfere with the actual display.

One thing that's great is that it holds a lot of cards without bending them as long as you don't try to move the book around in weird ways and what not. But that's about all this does. The book itself just looks like they took 2 x 20 page monster binders and then slapped them together into one binding, so overall its not really great for people who like to admire their cards frequently. Also, the outside material doesn't seem to be as tough as their other binders that are smaller, I wonder if this is because of the stress of having a larger capacity for cards or what, but the material on my particular binder is already starting to tear apart, but like I said, the cards are in good shape and are protected so I guess this binder is technically doing it's job haha. This Binder overall is great for people who buy/sell/trade a lot of their bulk and need something with a large capacity to carry all of their extra cards around, but if you want something that you can admire your cards in, just get the regular 20 page monster binders.", "review_title": "Good for bulk, that's about it.", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

Overall, I really like this case/sleeve. I do not have a Macbook so I tried it with two different sized computers and they both fit so there is plenty of room. The zipper opens on three sides which allows the case to open completely and lay flat on the table. The inside is cushioned and provides protection for the device. I do love the color though it looks closer to royal than navy blue. One downside for me is that there is no handle or strap with which to carry the case. The case would easily fit inside a backpack or briefcase but would be a bit more cumbersome to carry alone. In addition, the case is a fairly slick material so it can slip out of your hand while carrying. It is waterproof (I tested it by putting a sheet of paper inside and holding it out in the rain; the paper remained dry) and has a roomy zippered pocket on the outside for carrying a mouse or ear buds or other items.
