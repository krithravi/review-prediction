I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn\u2019t working properly.

Now once I set it up, I thought chatter about colors wasn\u2019t really gonna be a big deal, well it was. Had to spend 30 mins configuring the colors, and even then they weren\u2019t good. So my MAIN issue was, 6 days in the monitor began glitching had started flashing pink on the left side. I thought it was strange and thought nothing of it. Then it evolved to a full pink screen on the left side. That would stay for like 35 mins then disappear except lately it became permanent and no matter how I tweaked it it stayed their. So I\u2019ve decided to return this garbage monitor, while my time when it didn\u2019t have a pink half screen the picture quality was very good, and the 144hz is outstanding, 144hz makes 60hz look like the new 30fps while 144hz is the new 60, but that\u2019s the only upside for me.

A week later I got an email from them saying something along the lines of \"We're not going to replace the hard drive because when we received it, we observed a small dent on the outside which voids your warranty, have a nice day.\" It was completely fine before shipping and adequately protected, I wouldn't put it past them to have made the dent themselves.

The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty.

I tested it by plugging it in all over and watching my phone and my computer switch from the main WiFi signal to this extension signal. Worked great, for about 3 hours. Today, I\u2019m sitting in the middle of my house wondering why nothing is working. I check and yup, I\u2019m connected to the extension network. I switched signals to the main one and everything worked again. Less than 24 hours into it and I\u2019m requesting a return. 2 problems: when connected to this alternate signal (appearing to be full strength), nothing works. Also, it is trying to trump my main signal, even when I\u2019m sitting in between them and both are full strength. Do not buy.

At random times, the monitor would go dark (not completely off, but to a very dark brownish color where you could no longer see what was on the screen.

I really would advise you to go with another headset until Logitech fixes errors on their end.

So I will preface that this computer was barely USED by me until 3 months ago, and I've had nothing but problems since. There was no physical damage as far as I could tell however I've been having problems since I've decided to use it regularly: The wifi is very unstable and sometimes nonexistent, since I had to move from my laptop to using this desktop, I've been attempting to play games with my friends, only to disconnect every 30 minutes. Now I originally thought the issue was my internet provider, but none of my other devices were having issues. I decided to investigate my router, no issues at all. I move to the pc and I noticed that the usb dongle they include that either assists (or allows not even certain at this point anymore) the wifi connectivity was no longer operating. I removed it, and plugged it into my old laptop, it functioned, I attempted to use it on a different port, nothing. I decided to swap the usb with one that I knew was working, and it didn't work, AND afterwards that port ceased to function until next restart. THIS WAS ONLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF ACTUAL USAGE. (Computer was left untouched for most of a year and picked up for primary usage in May). I've been having this problem quite consistently with the ports, and I recently attempted to contact skytech support, of which all of their lines were busy and they had me leave my name and phone number and they'd get back to me as soon as possible. I called at 11 am PST (of which they are open until 5pm PST) and I didn't receive a call since. Now while this problem is quite recent, I would like to point out that this PC is not HTC VIVE compatible due to the fact that there is a significant lack of ports that actually function, some of the ports are not connected to the card which means they will NOT function whatsoever, so if you are using this computer for VR, your only option really is to get a RIFT S for it.", "review_title": "Buyers Beware!", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

The box says not to use while charging. I thought it was because of overheating, but it does not get hot at all. The tablet uses battery faster than it can charge, so that may be why. It takes at least 4 hours to fully charge. The thing that infuriates me the most, is the right shift key. It's different than the photos advertised, and is on the other side of the up arrow. I have small fingers so it's very hard to reach that key. On the plus side, it comes with a charger, but also can charge with a micro usb. It detaches easily from the keyboard, but stays on without problem if I need it to. Seems durable, but plastic screen has detached slightly already.

I nicknamed it Satan for the red backlit keyboard and didn't realize how accurate that nickname would be. Obviously it's faster and better than my other very outdated slow-as-molasses laptop, but in some ways the functions became worse. I can't even run some of the programs I used to, which is absolutely infuriating, because the firewall (I assume) is so aggressive even after I've turned it off. Not sure I can really blame the laptop model for that problem. But I can, (probably), blame it for constantly shutting off my wifi without warning and sometimes taking minutes to toggle on/off before it will fix itself. I can't get an explanation why it randomly decides to do this to me. Maybe just a windows 10 thing. But the worst problem which is distinctly a flaw of this laptop is when the entire thing crashes. It's only happened a couple times but when it happens it's Game Over. The keyboard stops responding, the screen freezes up, it makes a horrible screeching noise, and the power button does NOT work to turn off the computer. I'm not kidding, you can't turn the thing off whatsoever. It might be more bad luck or a deliberate design of the laptop, I'm not sure, but I can't even unscrew the back to try to remove the battery. The screw just turns and turns and turns and will never come out. Each time the laptop has crashed, I'm stuck with a frozen, endlessly screaming laptop and my only option is to stick it in another room where I can't hear it and wait for the battery to die. I'm just grateful I didn't have time-sensitive work to accomplish when the crashes happened, because it's already insanely frustrating. Fortunately, both times the laptop booted back up again just fine afterwards, and I can't be hassled to send it back. The funny thing is, I saw one review mentioning this problem and figured the odds were it wouldn't happen to me. Yeah. Don't be like me. Keep looking for something better, check the reviews, and spare yourself a lot of headache.", "review_title": "Wouldn't purchase again", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

Annoying as if you're working on something like a document, it will switch to 'read only' and you have to go through the whole motions of getting all the windows back up.

The packaging had been opened. The protective wrapper on the dock was gone. The optional rubber feet had been removed from the plastic bag and applied to the device and the empty bag was placed back in the box. The cables had obviously been unfurled and refolded in a messy way and stuffed into the box. The owners /. set up manual was completely missing. This is unacceptable for what was supposed to be a new device and it is relatively expensive. Since there was no obvious signs of damage I decided to connect the unit and fortunately it works as advertised. I had placed a return/replacement order which Amazon was promptly executing. Once I had the initial unit up and running I decided to cancel the replacement rather than going through the hassle of repackaging and shipping it.

Yes I understand they are suppose to handle up to 20 meters, but if they cannot handle 7 feet away to my bed from my PC they are worthless. I spoke to Kingston Tech Support and they felt it was interruption from my wireless network router. They told me to power cycle it and to move it to another room to fix the issue.

For starters, the tablet is a little longer and skinnier than I'd prefer. It's kind of awkward when writing in portrait, and slightly less awkward in landscape, but still weird. The S-Pen feels really nice but also has some drawbacks. The pen's accuracy is greatest in Samsung Notes, which personally, has a long way to go. Squid is the second best app for writing, but other than that, there are no other writing apps that work well with the tablet. The latency in other apps are bad enough to not even bother using the S-Pen. The button on the the S-Pen is ill placed and I accidently press it more than I'd like. I honestly should've returned it but I was past the return date. If you want a tablet to watch movies on and occasionally jot down a few things, this is it.

I thought at first maybe the receiver just doesn't work through walls (even though the transmitter was about 10 feet away)- but the keychain transmitter was able to ping in the exact same location so it's just a faulty transmitter. It does ping sometimes - but every time it has been after I'd already found the dang thing and brought it close to the transmitter to test that it was working at all. Defeats the point!

Nice matte-ish rose-gold color, lightweight, seems sturdy, easy to slip on to iPad. Used it for a few days when it finally occurred to me that something about the way the top right side back of the case bumps up against the iPad causes the volume button to go down to 0. At first I thought it was mildly annoying but something I could live with -- I would just push the volume back up to a good level every so often, not a huge deal. Then I realized that the only way I could keep the volume from constantly going down to zero was to hold the case (with the iPad in it) a certain way, and I had to be careful to not move it too much. If I changed position even slightly, the volume would again go down. My solution has been to keep the case on when I'm doing things that don't require volume (texts, facebook, email, reading), but to take the case off completely when I'm listening to audio. Which really kind of defeats the purpose. So while I'd really love to love this case, I just can't -- but I'm not upset enough to return it.

Not sure if the seller didn't provide adequate packing material or if the box was mishandled in transit. I was also a bit frustrated with the included CPU cooler mounting bracket as the holes were slightly misaligned, making the cooler installation a pain. But nonetheless, I went ahead with my build, until at 2am, as I try my first boot and all I get is a light show, no post, no display. While the board looked really nice in my custom PC and offered RGB and two m.2 slots (which I really wanted), sadly it refused to detect my brand new Ryzen 1700 and couldn't post. Interestingly enough, while the system was powered on, the board was able to provide power to the cpu cooler and the DIMMs but did not light up its own rgb areas. In the end I turned to the used Gigabyte B350 board I bought on craigslist for a backup! Buddy of mine said that most x370 boards are over-priced and now I know why. I went back and forth multiple times between boards to test different configurations (i.e. only 1 DIMM, etc.) and ultimately called it quits on this board. Not sure if the malfunction was due to handling, but I doubt it was a QA issue as this board was refurb iirc. Either way this was a headache for my first computer build, but also tested my ability to isolate hardware errors. Pics: 1 - Box, unopened - arrived as pictured, no packing material and with about 1-2 inch extra room on top and sides of the box (too big?) 2 & 3 - Box, opened - Shows small puncture in mobo box as well as a crunched corner (suggesting lots of movement inside of box, possibly previous wear and tear) 4, 5 & 6 - Box unopened - shows extent of wear on outer box, busted tape 7 - The MSI board plugged in with everything else lit up.", "review_title": "RMA: Damaged Delivery Box, Won't Recognize CPU, Won't Post - DOA", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

Durable and the legs don't actually break with my laptop weight. I'd give this thing 5 stars even though the color stuff is a bit funky with buttons instead of software. The real thing I take issue with is this taking up two usb 2.0 ports. My Alienware has two USB 3.0 ports, one of each side of the laptop, and two USB 3.1 C ports, one on the side and the other in the back. There was just no way to use the quality cooler with the \"y\" split power cable they provided without a usb hub and more out of pocket cost. This is ridiculous as a single USB 3 cable would have sufficed and frankly, I'm tired of companies dragging their feet on this standard that's been around many many years now. Thermaltake it's Nov 2018, almost 2019. Please get with the times and make a USB 3.0 cable so you don't need to use two USB ports up.

My primary requirement was 5.1 encoding via optical out, as that's what my speaker system uses (and what my X-Fi did without issue). After taking about 15 minutes to even find the 5.1 encoding options (they're hidden in the very poorly labelled \"cinematic\" section of the control panel), I was able to set both Dolby Digital Live and DTS and both work, at least initially. But over time I began to hear little pops and hiccups in the sound until the encoding would just fail and the sound would go silent, requiring me to go back to the control panel, turn the encoding off, and then back on again. This is now the standard pattern: set the encoding, it'll work for a while (usually an hour or two, sometimes less), then the audio will start to glitch a bit, until the fails, and the process has to be repeated. On top of all this, immediately after installing the card and updating the drivers from the Creative Labs web site (because the auto updater failed), every time I open the control panel or even switch audio devices (e.g. when using Bluetooth headphones) at least half a dozen \"bad image\" errors pop up complaining about a particular DLL. This doesn't seem to have any effect on any functionality but requires clicking to dismiss these alerts over and over again (and they are always on top so they cannot be ignored). I've tried reinstalling the drivers, disabling other devices, running driver cleaners, nothing has helped.

And that's probably why you're looking at this case. But it has some MAJOR problems. First, the case is HEAVY and THICK. This defeats the whole purpose of having an iPad Mini. The iPad Mini is so thin and light, but when you add this case - you take that ALL AWAY. For comparison, it ends up feeling heavier and being thicker than a Microsoft Surface Go with this case on. For people who use their iPad Mini one handed, this is a MAJOR problem. It feels heavy to use, especially if you're a woman, which the pink version of this product is targeted to. If you're an older woman, you'll definitely feel what I mean. What's especially cumbersome is the back part of the folio. It's a weird texture that your fingers will be resting on while holding the iPad mini vertically. The next bad thing is the screen. It's bad because there's a noticeable gap between the screen protector and the iPad Mini. When you are pressing on apps, you will notice that it isn't immediate, and it just feels weird. That will be because of the gap. And it can't be fixed. It's just the way the protector is made. To make matters worse, it's a PLASTIC screen protector. It's really cheap. Glass screen protectors are much better because it feels just like using the iPad Mini without a screen protector. A few other minor complaints: 1) Instructions aren't great. They have typos and this seller didn't even bother tailoring the instructions for the iPad Mini. It has the instructions for phones. 2) The smell. Typical of a 3rd party Chinese seller. Smells like it's made of stuff that can't be good for you. 3) Not as cute in person. 4) Folio can be seen from the front when you have the iPad mini standing in landscape mode, which kind of sucks. Other folios have it in the back. It's not that big of a deal, but I think it's more pleasing when you can't see the folded folio. 5) Overpriced. You're probably going to say that it's cheaper than a folio from Apple, and you'd be right. But at least you get support from Apple, and know that Apple has great quality assurance. You think a 3rd party Chinese seller is REALLY going to have that same level of quality assurance? Also, most of the reviews on this product are fake. Typical of a 3rd party seller in China. They undercut competitors and then purchase fake reviews. What I recommend is to buy a transparent case for you to show off the back of the iPad, especially if you have a Rose Gold variant. Then get a Glass Screen Protector. You'll end up saving some money and having a far more pleasant experience. Yes, you won't get the good looks of this case, but you'll end up having a far more premium experience when interacting with your iPad Mini.", "review_title": "Heavy, thick case that smells.

Also to note, this only seemed to be a problem on my windows computer. When I tried writing the board from Arduino IDE on Linux, simply putting the board into write mode seemed to work as expected. (I have no idea why) One more note, I could not get these boards to be recognized USB devices on Mac at all. Apparently there is a known driver signing issue between the driver for these, and Mac's running OS X 10.13 or higher, that to-date, has yet to be fixed.

It is exactly what I wanted, albeit at a bit of a premium though not off par for the chipset. I have unfortunately had to interact with Gigabyte's support/RMA process all for a fan on the cooler block that has an internal defect causing it to make a grinding noise constantly. This started happening within days of receiving and installing the card. First, to get to the RMA, you have at minimum two accounts to create and tickets to submit, one for tech support, another for RMA. Then they will ask you to send in the entire card for what could be a fairly simple swap of a fan, rather than just sending the fan. They will also drop the ball on communication, so you will have to hound them for answers. At this point I expect to replace the fan on my own dime. In short, despite the fan issue, this card has been pretty reliable for being so easily OC-able and I would probably choose this model over what else is available out there right now, unless I planned on setting up a custom water cooling setup. Dealing with the inferior fan quality control issue, including interaction with technical support, RMA dept., and customer service, has been far less than ideal.", "review_title": "5-star card + 2-star support for defective fan = 3-star product experience, to date", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

Within about an hour, I'd developed a rash there. And I'm not someone who's allergic to everything. I guess it was something they treated the leather with. It did not agree with me. So if you're prone to allergies I'd maybe think twice. Also in terms of them treating the leather, it's color didn't seem completely set. By that i mean that when I wore a pair of very pale pants, it was clear to see that the bag's leather brown leather color had rubbed off on me as I'd walked along. They were just Jean pants and so easy to clean, but I remember thinking at the time \"what if this had been someone's expensive pale winter coat or something that couldn't be simply thrown in the wash.\" So there you are.

I looked at screen from many angles and not one spec of dust. I did notice spots on protector as soon as I removed it from its nice foam sleeve. I passed it off too them to be on the glass or film side. After I applied the protector I could determine they were on the adhesive side. I now have two spots I constantly stare at cause I know where they are and how much time I took to make sure it was perfectly clean. I looked at the second in the two pack and it looks perfect. I would swap them out but paid for two so I guess I will try not to stare at the two spots until a replacement is needed. Otherwise this product would have achieved 5 stars across the board.

More than occasionally this drive will mount in android just fine at first and then after reading or writing to the disk it will unmount itself.. At first I thought this was some kind of time out in android, but no. It is a flaw with this drive. If I use any other type A drive (with a A to C adapter) I do not have this issue.

First, the screen is quite small (which I should have know), which makes text hard to read. It's OK to watch video, but difficult for tasks that require actual reading. Second; it is powered through an external AC source, which forces you to carry a power adapter when you travel, be near a power outlet when you work, and have an extra cable around your machine when you use it (see picture). Third, it does not have a built in stand. Instead, it comes shipped with a detached stand, which is an extra thing to carry around (without losing) when you travel.

But the performance is a little lacking and communicating with the extender isn't flexible.

If the SSID name is the same as the source SSID, it adds EXT to the name, which I don't like. I'd prefer the name the same as the source SSID so it is as close to mesh extenders as possible. If I'm using my phone, I simply disconnect and reconnect. It picks the SSID (source or extender) with the stronger signal. If the names are different, I have to consciously pick the SSID with the best signal. In order to fix those issues, I have to use a desktop browser via Ethernet. The only way to communicate to the extender wirelessly from the desktop browser is to press the reset button on the extender. But this erases the prior settings.

I had a little problem loading the software from the CD. But found that getting the software from the site was easier. I also didn't push the usb port all the way in (I guess my eagerness to use it distracted me from that little important step). So software and pen working, I started to use it. I would say it's kind hard to use for me because I use a mouse on my right hand and a write with my left hand and when I write I turn my paper to the side and it was hard to turn the tablet to the side and write in a straight line. I don't like that the placement of the pen on the tablet doesn't correspond to what you see on the computer screen. Kind of not liking the fact that the pen doesn't have to touch the pad to move the cursor on screen. I drew a picture with Microsoft Ink and I found it was difficult to control the pen and practiced my signature in Word and I found that writing straight across was difficult but then I had to consider that I do turn the paper sideways when I write since I'm left handed. So I had to slant the tablet in such a way that it would allow me to write straight. I tried writing my signature on Adobe acrobat pro but it was difficult because the writing strokes kept skipping and it wasn't consistent. When I purchased this tablet I just wanted something that would allow me to do some digital sketching, digital signatures, and maybe some digital painting. But the issue is control. I do like the pen but would prefer that it not have the buttons that interfere with my mouse and it moves the icons on my desktop. For 20 bucks, I expected a more simple effective tablet that's not too complicated to adjust. I want to give it a chance and I want to adjust to it. I had a wacom before (way back when) but didn't want one this time. So, it's not a bad tablet, but for me I have to get used to it first.

Could not return after reading that Western Digital (non-enterprise edition) disks do not support RAID in ICY Dock manual. In my case I wanted to provide a reliable and small backup drive to operate in RAID 1 mode to store all of my precious personal files and photos. The problem with RAID is that if the enclosure controller fails in a low cost system you will probably not be able to get an exact replacement and both of your redundant RAID 1 copies will need to be wiped. Also, the enclosure latches really are not secure and the fan is noisy even when set to lower speeds. Overall, I would suggest consumers buy 2 backup drives with adequate capacity for their application. Run automatic backup and do a manual backup every 3 or 6 months on the second drive. This drive should be stored in a remote location from the main backup drive in case of fire, flood or other disaster.

The case is a nice quality and the color is a pleasant blue. The construction is solid and overall it seems to be well made. I\u2019m coming from the trifold style of cover and this cover has a different set up. It leaves a larger footprint on your work surface because of the way it is propped up on the flat inside front of the cover. This will just take some getting used to and isn\u2019t necessarily bad. The other issue I have is with the way the hard shell internal case is only attached to the spinning mechanism on one side. It is necessary so that the iPad can rotate, but this makes the larger iPad Pro feel a little unsafe because without paying attention it flops open when folding the cover back to hold in the hands as opposed to propping. The iPad seems securely attached to the hard shell but it is awkward. I\u2019m thinking that perhaps adding a magnet to the back of the hard shell case on the left edge of the vertically oriented iPad so it would delicately attach and be easy to pull off for propping and rotating would easily remedy this. In fact, I\u2019ll probably go buy a sticky magnet and try that.

The logo appears to be laser etched into the plastic which actually looks quite nice. Overall if you have a heavy graphics card don't buy this. If you just want to add a bit more lighting then it may be for you. Absolutely not worth the price, there are better options for cheaper however they likely won't have any RGB lighting built in.", "review_title": "I question whether or not this will actually be able to support a graphics card without breaking as it seems like a pretty cheap", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

After buying it I decided I wanted another one for home too. I ended up grabbing that one locally on my way home one day. It turns out there are actually 2 versions of this mouse. The Ergo and the Ergo Plus. I didn't know the difference before. The Ergo only lets you pick between 0 or 20 degrees. The Ergo Plus has an extra wedge that allows you to get the angle up to 30 degrees. It is removable so you have 0, 10, 20, 30 as options on that version of this mouse. The wedge is the only difference between these versions. The mouse itself has a rubbery place for your palm to rest. It is nice, the ball spins freely. You can hit a button to adjust the precision. Coming from other mice, I initially found myself often hitting that button to go \"back\" on web browsers. The forward and backward buttons are a little hard to get to even after using it for over a week, it is awkward to hit back. I know you can remap these but forward is just a little less awkward. It looks like the wedge can only be found in a bundle, which is exclusive to a certain store. I contacted Logitech and have gotten no answer from them at all to see if I could buy it separately. It seems silly to have to return a mouse to buy the same mouse for the same price just to get a small rubber wedge in the package.", "review_title": "Nice, but Customer Service doesn't reply.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

The positives, It did come with Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit. 8 GB of Ram as advertised and a Seagate 500 GB HDD. Works great. Does exactly what I need it to do, which is to run back office software at my store. For the price, I really am satisfied with it.

I had one of those bendy-arm tablet holders, which was way too stiff, and short, to be of any value, and it constantly fell over if I pushed it too far in the direction of the screw base, as it would just loosen the screw, and fall over. This doesn't work the same way, so I figured it would be great. And it is better. It doesn't unscrew, & it's a lot easier to push out of the way, when not in use. Unfortunately, it is not great to take pics with, as it won't stay in position. In an effort to allow users to view from any height, they made a super loose connection at the first ball joint, so when you move the swing arm, the tablet maintains it's dangling, upright position. I suppose that would be good, if I was just watching from a seated position, however I gotta think that's not good for folks in bed, or for me, who wants to aim it down to take pictures. I have to hold it in position to take the pics, which renders videos useless, since I can't really work with just one hand. The price was good for two, & it will work well for my other tablet, which I only watch videos on, but it's not good for taking pics, unless you only want to take pics of things directly in back of it - straight on. Table top viewing is not going to happen, unless you provide a hand to hold it. Pros: * Sturdy metal base clamp. (probably aluminum = non magnetic) * Arm re-positions easily. * Stays where you put it. Cons: * Dangles to keep tablet always in upright position. * Not in love with the holder. Uses clamp on back, but forces you to tighten screws in back to keep tablet pushed forward for a better grip. I worry about the pressure points in back, since there is no way to know if I've screwed it too tight, or not tight enough... until it's broken, or falls out. The phone holders that come with it are much better. They offer a nice clamping feature from the sides, with a single press to release button. No screws to tighten, no clamps to fiddle with blind.

I am not aware of any studies on shelf life for new (in the box) drives. I would imagine there is a possible concern about lubricants within the drive drying out from sitting for several years on the shelf. My point here is that the vendor should have (in my opinion) been more transparent about the age of this drive. I am deducting two stars for this lack of transparency.

In general, I was impressed. The most recent order, however, was not so good. I bought the most recent of these for a family vacation. I got the cord and it worked at first.

Then, at home, (only a week after purchase) it really started to fail. Now, it's basically useless. Given that I bought several of these and only one seems to have gone south, I had to consider how to rate it. On the one hand, three out of four were good. The last one was defective.

Trying to get the right features is frustrating to say the least. I had great hopes that the MoKo would be the right one, but it just fell short in a few areas. It does have some good features, but not enough to keep me from trying other cases first. In my opinion, this is a case that had/has potential, but I just couldn't get over the stand portion. It doesn't cover the kickstand of the surface pro, and the case makes pulling out the kickstand tough. The build quality could have been just a bit better. For instance, the bottom portion where the keyboard sits is flimsy. It appears to rely on the keyboard to protect that section of the Surface Pro. To compare it to cases like the UAG, which I had on my Surface Pro 3, and the bottom portion of that case is much sturdier. The UAG however is a completely different build and is much heavier. Unlike the UAG which uses its own kickstand, the MoKo allows the use of the Microsoft kickstand which has a greater tilt ability that is great for drawing applications Overall the case has a good weight to it- not too heavy while still providing decent protection for most of the surface pro. It does have a pen holder which is very convenient. However, with the keyboard section being flimsy they could have made it better. They could have added some protection for the actual kickstand, that would have set this far apart from the Kensington. FYI: price wise, this is cheaper than the Kensington and appears to be pretty much the same. If you do get this case. I would recommend some cover for the kickstand, perhaps a \"skin\" application just to prevent it from getting scuffed.", "review_title": "It is a good case, just needs a bit of improvement.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

They use a one-of-a-kind fan/rgb hub that connects to molex and has no speed control. The noise issue could have easily been solved by adding a fan speed contol or simply allowing the fans to be connected to the motherboard directly and be controled by software such as Asus Aura. The RGB is controled via IR remote that isn't the best method but it does work.

When I'm using it in landscape with the key pad, I love the fact that there are three adjustment positions for screen viewing. The keyboard is thin and folds up nicely against the screen when not in use. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives with this package. The entire package is just too thick and bulky. I previously used an Apple cover for the iPad Air 2 that was extremely thin and light. My heart just sank at the weight of the Fintie combo when I opened the box. The keyboard is compact and has all the right keys that you would want but they have a deep press and click that reminds me of keyboards from 20 years ago. That mushy press creates a noticeable lag when typing that gets uncomfortable. The keyboard is also magnetic, which allows you to move it around. That has good and bad aspects as well... like what do I do with it when I'm not using it? The biggest dislike is that since its so bulky, I often use it without the keyboard. Then the cover becomes very awkward since it doesn't fold up where you want it to and becomes a chore to hold in the landscape position. And then you have to remember where you left the keyboard... I'll be keeping this combo since it does what it says it does. Nonetheless, it is big and heavy and I'll just keep searching for something sleeker. I just don't understand why no one makes a keyboard cover for an iPad that has the same slim design as the cover for a Microsoft Surface tablet.", "review_title": "Heavy and bulky with mushy keys", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

The keyboard is very easy to type on despite the smaller size, connects without issue and it\u2019s just what I wanted.

The front pocket does have a mesh zipper pocket and small dividers, but I have not found them to be particularly useful at actually holding things. The other thing I find sub-optimal is that the two larger pockets bulge at the bottom where items collect and they make the bag uneven; the bag won't sit up on its own, which is most likely due to the fact that the bag can be opened flat for airport security purposes.

The no-button design is a nightmare for dragging and dropping with CAD applications. It had to be replaced with a wired HP mouse. The keyboard is nice and small, but after a few weeks it started to repeat keys. I contacted, and spent a considerable time with, HP support on this issue. After the support session it improved; but after several days the key repetitions came back. So I finally replaced the keyboard with a Logitech mechanical keyboard and I am happy with it. So now the machine is a dream! I am an old school computer user and enjoy the tactile feedback of the mechanical keyboard.

The remote is light, but not flimsy and the keys give good audible and tactile feedback. Typing is easy and despite the light weight I didn't find myself struggling to keep the remote still while I was typing. Using the track pad is easy, but it at times it would act like, well, like a track pad. If you have extremely high expectations for any track pad you're doing it wrong. The overall biggest drawback to this remote is that I couldn't pair it with other devices plugged into the TV. If you have a smart TV that has a great processor and have a remote that is the flip phone equivalent of TV remotes, this is a great choice for under 20 clams.

I tried out Disney Circle but sent it back as it crushed my Google Fiber Gigabit internet performance (I wrote a review on that). This device has everything I need and the AV for computers and phones is really nice and easy to use. The major thing that could be improved is the parental control and reporting interface. Its a mix of on device application, and cloud based application. As soon as I figured that out (not well documented) I was able to get pretty much what I wanted out of it. Due to that the interface is a bit clunky and not the smoothest to figure out or manage, but definitely not the worst I have ever worked with.

Therefore, this device gets hot -- REALLY hot, even when it's not in use and merely plugged into the USB slot! Depending on how tough you are, you could burn your fingers within seconds! The first time I used it, I was in for a \"hot\" surprise! ;) (-) If you need to frequently swap microSDXC cards, you are probably better off using a microSD adapter with an appropriate card reader instead. I personally rarely take my 200GB card out of the card reader. * Bottom line: This is a great little microSDXC card reader that takes up very little space and fits great in my wallet. I applaud the genius who came up with the idea of placing a microSDXC card under the USB connector! However, since this device is getting very hot, I would at least place a warning sign somewhere on the housing, or redesign it with a bigger heat sink.

I can comfortably watch a movie too, but if I didn't also have a TV, I'd have chosen the bigger Yoga screen. I love how portable it is, and that it can be used as a notebook or tablet. Awesome. The screen optics are gorgeous. Only two things I don't like. The shift key is smaller than normal and in the wrong place. Long story short, it's maddening but I think I'll adjust. Secondly, during set up, why isn't there a nice invitation to watch a full tutorial on how to explore your new device and learn not only the basics of how to navigate a Yoga, but also learn what various tricks your notebook is capable of and what features it offers? Why wouldn't Lenovo include an official tutorial, if only to cut down on the volume of service calls? I read thru the printed info that came with the device, but no mention of a tutorial there either. I hated to do it, but I deducted a star for that. If there IS a tutorial included, I couldn't find it, and that's just as bad as there not being one. It should be super easy to find. So glad I chose this elegant two-in-one!! So thin and light, and my daughter informs me I got it at a really great price right here on Amazon.

Nothing can simulate hardwiring. The set-up took multiple attempts (just supposed to push a button on both units w/in a certain time frame). Once set-up, they have had little issue, and will reset themselves after power outages, so that's nice. As for performance, there is an increase in speed. I'm using it to speed up a PS4 which is on a different floor from the router. Speed increased from single digits (MBPS) to nearly 20. It is noticeably faster, but again, no where close to 100 or what hardwired could be. In fairness, one of the units is plugged in near a washer/dryer (they recommend being far away from large appliances...they negatively affect performance). This was unavoidable for me due to plug and router location. So final thoughts: if you're just streaming, seems perfect (I have no buffering delays compared to hard-wired devices). Download speeds for PS4 are good, but I don't play online so I cannot comment on that. Also, consider the flexibility of your set-up locations; appliances really do seem to have an effect. And one last bonus thought...these are way better than wireless extenders. I have one of those for another floor and while it does increase range, the performance/speed is much slower.", "review_title": "set-up took multiple attempts; does increase speed, but not a A LOT of other variables", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

It should be combined with the volume button. Now the small area of operation plate looks crowded, and the push in/out power button is not as easily controlled as the turning power button. 3. There should be a small white dot on the volume control button to indicate how big the current volume is. 4. You might want to think about producing some product with white color.

It seemed to work fine at first but now it will not stay connected to the computer. The \"Q\" almost continually flashes as if it is trying to be discovered, the computer says it is connected but suddenly all the keys will stop working or stop working correctly. I got this for my husband as a gaming keyboard so he could just relax and be able to see the keys but instead he ends up being totally frustrated because suddenly he cannot do anything. Sometimes if you plug it in, or unplug it if it is plugged in, it will goose it to work for a few minutes before it goes out again. It is charged up, the computer connection says it is charged to 100%. If you turn the bluetooth off and just plug it in, it will work as a wired keyboard but the connection is loose so you have to be very careful to keep it plugged in. Of course this happens right after the 30 day return period is up. $46 is not something we have to just throw away on stuff so I am really unhappy. Update: The seller was very helpful and found the keyboard to be obviously defective. Even though it worked for a short time something is wrong with the bluetooth in it. They replaced the keyboard immediately even though it was a couple days past the return window. The replacement seems to be working as intended--so far. We are very happy with this keyboard when it is working and I expect the replacement to continue to do so. It has seemed happier from the very start and the charging cord sits in the socket much more securely. The original defective one had more than one issue which the replacement does not seem to have. Changed up to 4 star because of the good service and because the replacement seems to be in good shape. Would have been 5 star except for the stress and hassle. Seller got a 5 star rating for good service.", "review_title": "Defective One Stopped Working--Replaced by Seller", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

But screen flickers are not the only problem with VGA. After a couple hours of use, the entire screen got shifted right on my monitor. I could not solve this issue either. Attached is a photo displaying this problem. Consequently, I ended up purchasing a separate USB C to HDMI adapter that I can use instead of the VGA for use with my dual monitors.

The one I was looking at only had VGA capability and no separate graphics card, and I wanted to be able to use my monitor in high definition with an HDMI cable. This card was easy to install in the computer--just make sure you have an open PCI-e slot and it pops right in. It only takes one slot. Even if you've never done this before it isn't very challenging, it's pretty easy to tell which is the PCI-e slot by looking at the card and looking at the slots in your computer and matching them up. There are plentiful videos on YouTube to walk you through this. The card has worked flawlessly through burn in and has been in the computer for a week or so now. The only issue I had was the refusal by Windows 10 to allow me to load the driver included with the card, since it isn't digitally signed. Not a big deal, I just went to the ATI website and downloaded their driver and it works fine and has more features than the software included with the card. I don't use this card for heavy gaming--my wife plays Candy Crush on it and it works just fine.

I fly FPV and transferring video to my phone for review is tedious with a slow connection. This fixed that. Fast transfers, pretty well built (I like the cap), and can read a microsd in addition to a full sized SD card. I think that, in time, the grip on the cards will loosen...it seems to have slightly already (maybe 50-60 insertions/removals). Still, the little click when you lock your card in is very assuring .Personally, I would like to see the SD card spring loaded and/or under a cap so keeping it in the pocket wouldn't be a concern. As it is, the ports are exposed and likely to attract lint and other pocket debris.

It even lifted up and let me remove a cat hair (lol) and settled back down perfectly. There is only one little spot where there must have been a speck of dust but it is not noticeable when the screen is lit up. It works any which way - even at an angle (don't ask). I even use it as a handle to carry the tablet around although I didn't expect to.

I think what I was most impressed with this purchase however was the support that came with the product which I think is unusual for a low value accessory. I had initial issues with the connection so I emailed support and they responded quickly having me check my HDMI cord. Sure enough I had a bad HDMI cord and replacing it was the solution. Don't expect a extreme support but getting any support with an accessory is a plus!

So I got this, figuring the battery AND charger together were still LESS than a repair shop would charge just to look at it. I read the reviews, and even though one Youtube video said I should buy ONLY an ASUS cord, I found that my laptop is a few years old so....the reviews on this looked good.

On extreme when there maxed out there is very quiet whirl to the pump but literally any ambient noise downs it out. Installation was easy, used there supplied thermal paste. Works just fine. Only reason I am replacing my paste is because im delidding my cpu or it would still be using the pre applied paste. Couldnt ask for a better product. Instructions were easy to read. Pump is powered via Sata connector. Usb plug in is for ICue to read pump and to adjust colors. Fan splitter is to hookup all three fans to pump.

I read the reviews and they were great! This Purgo USB C Hub Adapter fits perfect in the 2 outlets to connect to MY Air! I highly recommend this product and would definitely tell all of my friends that are afraid of up grading their computers! When this product is inserted, it's a perfect match with the MacBook Pro. There is no gap and the edge parallels with the laptop. It's made of aluminum alloy and it touches like the shell of the Macbook. The charging speed and the data transmission speed are both very fast. All the interfaces can work at the same time and don't disturb each other. So far, no problem is found.

But this time I decided to go the other route after doing my researching and finding out the ludicrous costs of keyboards from brands like razer and corsair. I was hesitant at first because this product is obviously from china and from a not so known brand. But after looking at the high reviews from other customers, I decided to take the plunge. I went with the stainless steel, blue-back lit option. So far after a year of use, I'm happy to report that this product is worth the cost. For only $40 you get a well made product with good (but unnecessary) features. The clicks are very tactile and is a joy to use. They are extra loud which some of you might prefer. But be aware that the loud noise might be an annoyance to others. I had to use my laptop keyboard in my room at night to not awake my roommate. Tha back lit feature is welcome but after using it for the first month, I leave it off. Actually, I'm only writing this review because I enjoy the typing experience on the keyboard so much and am using it to write this.

Con's are: Screen protection, which is part of the case, slightly diminishes the touch sensitivity of the screen. The kick stand, as I said, is the real magic. This is a kick stand on steroids. The base of the stand is an octagon that rotates 360 degrees. The octagon base is surrounded by a trim piece which is attached to the base via a friction hinge. This piece can be opened up to 180 degrees. This is more magic. By rotating the base and opening the trim piece you can use your tablet at any angle you choose.

In doing all of these things I can also charge my phone, etc. It makes everything so much more convenient, truly a life-saver!

The signal barely reached to the upstairs corner of my home where I had my office. It was enough for my devices to see and connect to my network, but not enough for video or fast browsing. So, I went to Amazon in search of a Powerline kit to augment my ISP's WiFi connection. I eventually settled for this product. I was worried that it would not work, as the two rooms I planned to place the two units in were on different breaker boxes. However, the units connected to each other in about 1 minute. I connected a spare router to one end and my ISP's WiFi modem to the other, and it works great! Would recommend to those who have a medium level of technical knowledge, but otherwise it works great!

The magnets are more than strong enough to hold the tablet holder, and the tablet firmly to the side of the refrigerator.

I like how I could choose the exact model to ensure the right size esp as I have a 2011 Macbook with the CD slot--and not many sell specifically for it. The material's quality is great and sturdy, esp for the price. It is exactly as described. I chose the white marble design, and it doesn't get dirty easily. The light from the apple logo shines through when open but not when closed (due to the light turning off). The instructions made the installation easy. The only thing not good is the keyboard cover -doesn't adhere consistently so the transparent color is also inconsistent. Some of the black of the keys peek through but only in the center of the key. I would compare it to how a wet spot on a clothing looks darker, only this is a keyboard cover and it's not wet. But then I didn't buy this for the keyboard cover and didn't even know it came with it. Verdict: buy it only if you don't need a keyboard cover or ok with just buying an additional keyboard cover elsewhere.

At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I\u2019ve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019v Had it for over a week with no problems. It\u2019s faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast.

The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.
