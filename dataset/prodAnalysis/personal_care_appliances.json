I used this product on one run of 10 miles on a steep technical rocky single track trail. I was worried that the side piece would catch on rocks or roots but that never happened. I was also worried about an unbalanced feel and I never had that sensation either. It was like it wasn't there. I was wearing Hoka brand shoes (which have a high stack height) and I could not get the side rubber piece to stay 1/4\" above the sole. It always rode higher. I also found the strap that goes under the shoe to be of low quality. After one run it was nearly completely warn through. All that being said, I did end up convinced that this product is a good idea. In fact, I almost kept it with the idea of cutting the rubber side piece off the brace and just gluing it to the side of my shoe with some really strong glue. I decided the rubber piece is not worth $30 and I might be able to just glue some high density foam on the side of my shoe and accomplish the same thing. I wonder if this product will work better with shoes with a more traditional sole. I should also mention I did not roll my ankle during the 10 mile run. It is a little hard to say whether that is because of the brace or because I don't roll my ankle on every run. I decided that because the brace was fitting so poorly that it probably was not because of the device.", "review_title": "Trail running experience", "language": "en", "product_category": "personal_care_appliances"}
