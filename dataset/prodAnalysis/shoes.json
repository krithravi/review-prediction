First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the \"peep,\" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.", "review_title": "Definitely not worth $90 based solely on the fit", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}

I am so disappointed because I paid too much for these shoes that are apparently very cheaply made. BE CAREFUL. Also they do run a tad bit small and you can\u2019t size up a half size.

Also, the edge of the strap on the top of my foot rubbed my foot raw. I have scarred/healed rubbed off skin area on my feet now. Yikes! Too bad because the footbed is incredibly comfortable and the style is cute. I have to change my four star review to 2 stars because I can\u2019t wear them and they gave me broken skin and scars.

Things to consider before buying: First off they run large. Secondly they are very vented. The entire tops of these shoe is a mesh type of material that breaths very well. No soo good when dealing with winter weather though. I love the slip on aspect of the shoe due to the nature of my work. However that backs of the shoe likes to bunch up when putting them on and it's not exactly easy to fix once your foot is in the shoe. You have to take measures to prevent that as your foot slides into the show. This is the reason behind my low rating of these shoes: First off the tread collects everything due to the small gaps in the tread. If you are out in the rain, snow, or mud you will carry that stuff on the bottom of your shoe for a very long time once you come in doors. Water doesn't even clean out very well. So tracking even water becomes an issue. These are also worthless in the snow or ice. Very slick and absolutely no traction. I fell at work due to this problem. Wet floors is even a problem. My biggest issue with these shoes is a manufacturer defect. There is some sort of seam right next to my big toe witch that had caused me to stop wearing the shoes. It hurts and causes me to walk in a way to try and avoid it. This causes a tremendous amount of pain in my feed by the end of the day.

The sole is a bit too stiff, but definitely sturdy and could easily handle some off terrain walks.

I guess that would be fine if it held up. But it did not hold up. Ive been wearing them almost daily for shower shoes and the toe piece on the right sandal has slipped halfway out rendering the sandals unwearable after only a few months use for a few minutes a day. No outdoor hiking, no running or tennis. no catching the front of the sole on anything. just walking down the hall to the shower and back. Maybe it is the heavy duty stiff sole. Maybe the right sandal didn't get enough glue and it's a fluke. I don't know. What I do know is that for the price I paid I would have expected to get several years of heavy use out of them but they barely lasted 6 months of the lightest possible use.

They actually look good in the pictures and in person, however, they feel cheaper than a pair of $10 backup glasses I got from Walmart. And these Oakleys are even more uncomfortable then the Walmart glasses. They are constructed of plastic and the nose area is wide and flat with no cushioning. Although these glasses feel light in your hand, they do have some heft weighing down on your nose. So it was uncomfortable from the moment I put them on. Cant imagine how they would feel after an hour of wearing. The matte version of these are coated in some sort of powdered rubber material which looks nice, but any products I ever known with this material always breaks down and starts chipping off. Probably even quicker when exposed to sun, heat, sweat...etc. One thing I do like about these glasses in comparison to other Oakleys (or many other glasses in general) are they fold up much flatter than most. They did not come with a case though. Only a flimsy bag which wont protect much of anything. Not really sure whats going on with these big name sunglass companies these days....? I am in the market for new glasses because my expensive Under Armor glasses which I only owned for a couple years died a slow death from the day I bought them. I checked out a few other pairs of oakleys, and they seem better made. But nothing like what they used to be. Its a shame because these really look nice.

If your glasses are wire-frames, this won't be an issue, but if they're a bit thicker, you'll need two hands to put them on or take them off. This is something I wish I'd realized, especially since they don't flip up. The photos showed them clipped onto plastic frames, so I guess I thought this wouldn't be an issue, but it basically means that if the weather's partly cloudy, I can't really wear them while driving unless I'm stopping a lot. Still though, the tint is nice, not too dark, and more toward yellow which handles bright sunlight without diminishing vision.

I'd read some reviews of these shoes and had high hopes, as I'd read they were good running shoes for walking.

There is also a zippered pocket on the back and an interior one where I kept school supplies. The internal pocket fit quite a few notebooks and books as well as my 13\" MacBook Air with no issue. My only issue is the durability of the leather loop that holds the clip where the strap is attached. It started to show some wear after only a couple months and finally it ripped and the strap fell off in the middle of the day when I was at school.

I have been wearing the typical plain black \"work shoes\" since 2001. I've burned through many pairs of work shoes from different brands and for the most part, not a single pair has held up for more than a year or so. This shoe was no exception. I will say that top of the shoe (the part that other people see) is holding up fine after 15 months now. With other shoes I have owned, the top part gets tore up, creased and ugly after a year. I don't abuse my shoes, but I wear them daily and I walk and crouch often. However, it is the other parts of the shoe that concerns me. The memory foam felt awesome for a few months, but around the year mark (or sooner), that memory foam no longer remembered anything. It became flat and nonexistent. Sad considering I sit more than I stand or walk at work, so it's not like I was standing all the time and smashing it down. Also, the tread on my shoes is completely wore off, so any surface that is remotely slippery is unsafe for me to walk in in these shoes. No matter what brand of shoe I buy, whether they're $60 or $20, none of them are that great after a year.", "review_title": "An Honest Opinion", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}

I had been purchasing this style Acorn slippers for a long time. I skipped a couple of winters to try their other styles & decided to go back to the Spa Wraps only to find out they've been redesigned. They're bulkier, the velcro on the strap which holds the slippers on your feet is weak & almost nonfunctional, the elastic in the heal that keeps the back on your foot is useless regardless of size, (correct or size up), the sizing is no longer true & the arch support is gone.

Tons of pockets keep me organized and it has amazing space capacity which is awesome since I have 3 kids. The only con is that if you use the stroller straps it's hard to zip the bag closed since it's hanging oddly from the straps. But you can't have it all right?

This one has nylon zippers and they do work fine. The material doesn't feel like genuine leather to me, but more like a man-made material that tries to replicate leather, and does it fairly well. It's close enough that I can't swear that it's not real leather, however, for the price that I paid, I didn't expect it to be genuine leather (again, it might be genuine, I really can't tell for sure). Basically at this point, if it lasts a few more months without defect, I will feel that I have gotten my money's worth, and after that, if it should fail in some way, I will probably buy another one just like it, perhaps a different color just to change things up a bit.

I explained that, although the glasses are too small for my son, he liked them and didn\u2019t want to return them. He likely will not wear them, but it\u2019s his gift to return, or not return. The Mr Happy Store offered me a 30% refund, which I felt was generous, considering we didn\u2019t return them. They also pointed out the sizing of their glasses on the website. I very much appreciated their customer service and willingness to work with their customers. Their product is well made and stylish. As I said in my first review, they are small on my kid, but I would check the dimensions and take a chance if you like the look. This seller is very responsive, so you can\u2019t lose anything! Bought these for my son. Firstly, I read reviews before my purchase, regarding size and quality. My son is built like a football player, he\u2019s tall and has an extra large head/face. Someone mentioned they fit a large face, so I took a chance. They are much too small for his face. The quality is good and the lenses are, indeed, as dark as they say. If you\u2019re sporting a head that fits a large frame, these might not be for you. Maybe the manufacturer could make a larger version of their round sunglasses?", "review_title": "Updated review!", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}

I had just about given up on finding a new band for my tracker that wasn\u2019t made of ugly cheap plastic like the band it comes with when purchased. The whole point of buying the Alta model of a Fitbit was the fact that it was waterproof and supposedly held a charge for 7-10 days, which means after a full charge I should be able to wear the tracker for 7-10 days, without removing it during that time frame. I knew the band the Alta came with was functional but ugly, but I had done some research and discovered that there were all sorts of replacement bands available to purchase, unlike the Fitbit HR I currently owned, which comes with an attached band that isn\u2019t removeable. So I bought the Alta model, and started looking for a nice band for it. I really wanted something in sterling silver, but was never able to find a band made in silver, so instead I spent $100 on a stainless steel bangle made by a designer who will go unnamed, it lasted about 6 months, then the plastic insert that connected the bangle to the tracker broke and fell out, leaving me with a useless bangle that couldn\u2019t be repaired or refunded or exchanged. After that, I bought several other bands advertised to be stainless steel but weren\u2019t, and a few leather bands that were so cheaply made they broke after a few wears. I bet at this point I have wasted more money on bands than I spent on the actual tracker to start with. Another issue was the bands all came with shiny chrome-like metal clips where they attached to the tracker, and the Alta is made of a burnished silver, so the clips and the tracker didn\u2019t match and it looked stupid. maybe I\u2019m the only one who has had this problem, but I find that hard to believe. This last time I ordered 4 bands from four different companies, a black band, metal, similar to a watch band, with a metal clasp, a brown leather band with a buckle clasp, a double wrap band made with metal links advertised as stainless steel and embellished with semi-precious stones, and this band. This band and the black band are the only two I\u2019m keeping, and I may have to return the black one as well, despite having come with a tool and directions for use, I haven\u2019t been able to remove any links to adjust it and in its current size it\u2019s unwearable. This band is pretty and doesn\u2019t look like a strictly sport/athletic band, like the plastic bands do, so I can wear it with other jewelry without it sticking out like a big black rubber thumb, it\u2019s elastic/stretchy, so it doesn\u2019t require adjustment in order to use it, the clips which attach the band to the tracker are the same burnished steel as the tracker and match it, providing a seamless fit when the tracker and the band are connected, and finally the band is reasonably priced. Whether or not it\u2019s durable remains to be seen, but if it isn\u2019t then I\u2019m only out $10 versus $100.", "review_title": "A PRETTY BAND THAT FITS FINALLY", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}

I study everything on my tablet and I\u2019ve wearing them for 45 minutes and until removing them off to see if they make a difference, and wow they really do.

So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter.

They are adorable - true to photo. The high-top design of the opening not only keeps my ankles warm, it also keeps the slippers from coming off easily -- and from shopping around, this seems like a pretty unique feature. The slippers are very well-padded and feel very snug on the foot (although most of the padding is actually on top of the foot; there's not much padding on the sole, so if you're walking in these a lot, it will probably flatten.) All of these aspects make me really want to love these slippers. BUT I'm so let down by the fabrication. They seem to have focused entirely on the exterior of the slipper and ignored the interior. I want these to keep my feet cozy. But the interior fabric is not very soft, and doesn't feel good on my feet. Even worse, there is an exposed seam running around the interior of the slipper -- i.e. the fabric is sewn together, and the two ends are not tucked behind the seam, but extrude into the interior of the slipper and poke into my feet. Basically, every time I wear these I want to put on socks, to make my feet more comfortable -- but if I'm already going to put socks on, I don't really need the slippers, so...
