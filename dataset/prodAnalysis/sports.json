Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far.

I reread through reviews and noticed a trend that if kids were using the trampoline (and I am guessing hanging on the bar) the legs tend to fall off. We are now researching a better model.", "review_title": "Legs will fall off", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous.

It also had a list of items in the box that were supposed to be included in my package, all the items were checked off like it was inspected, including a 'sling' which was also not in the box, even though it was checked off, it did not come with one. I bought this as a first crossbow gift to my sister and purchased everything, the crossbow target block, extra lube wax, extra arrows and the Barnett crossbow case that came recommended to fit this model (which it did not and I am also returning, but this is a different issue all together). I contacted the seller and I got an email back saying their customer service is closed until Sunday because of Jewish Shabbat. So what am I supposed to give her as a gift now? The extra items I purchased to go with her crossbow, without the actual crossbow?! 'Happy birthday sister, I got you a crossbow, but it was missing items and I had to send it back, so here is the accessories to it.' Yeah, that's going to go over well. I don't often write bad reviews, but had I not checked it thoroughly and put it together myself (or at least tried to), I would have given her an item that could have seriously injured her because it was not bolted down properly from lack of missing items.

It does not properly record sleep as it thinks just sitting on the couch watching a movie is light sleep. Highly disappointed in the product. I guess I'll just have to toss it and move on. The company does not answer any questions nor emails. Very upset over it. ****** Finding it is not accurately hitting my sleeping patterns as it is using my laying down as light sleep instead of me actual sleeping, but I will continue to keep my eye on it and update when necessary.

Once I took it out I found that sand was literally packed into all of the mechanisms. Very hard to turn the top assembly and the legs did not drop freely when I pulled the trigger. I packaged back up and requested a replacement from Amazon. The second one came to me and although it still had the blister pack on top, the legs were all marked up and one was bent. No signs of sand in the mechanism of this one but overall condition was poor. I have requested another replacement from Amazon and will update this review once it is received.

The sleep tracking has been wrong every night so far. I go to bed around 8 pm, the tracker tells me I'm going to bed at midnight. I wake up and get ready for the day around 5 am, tracker says I woke up at 7 every day. The heart rate takes about a full minute to actually show on the watch and then it jumps all over the place. It goes from 80 to 100 to 60 to 70 all within seconds. When I check the app, it says I was at 62 all day every day. So I guess it's just not tracking the heart rate at all. If you want it to track an activity you have to actually set it to your watch (limit of three activities only) then hold down the button to begin and end the activity instead of it tracking automatically. Basically, I'm just using it as a watch. As far as the step counter..it is okay. It tracks my steps during the day however it has the same down fall as the Fitbit where I could just be eating or doing my hair and it'll think I walked 400 steps just because I was moving my arm. If you want a step counter and watch combined go ahead and get this but if you want the other features such as heart rate detector and sleep tracker I'd pay extra and choose a different brand. The only thing that I prefer about this watch over my old fitbit was that to charge it you could just plug it into your normal wall plug instead of looking for a special charger.", "review_title": "Tracking Mistakes Every Day", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

I previously had used a pair of Adidas brand batting gloves and they were great until they fell apart from use.

There is absolutely NO leather in these gloves at all... they are spandex with some type of polymer composite palm grip. I kept them and used them for the mail because the price was right, BUT they were not very durable at all. The stitching of the grip side of the fingers is splitting in multiple places in only 2 months of use. As I said, I deliver mail with them, so I don't know how much stress these gloves would take if I was actually using them as batting gloves. I will say, though, that the polymer/composite grip is not particularly \"grippy\"... the steering wheel slides right through my hands.

Took it out of the container, followed the short instructions, and filled with pre-filtered water to test it. Pros: The \"straw\" part is covered so that it will not get dirty while carrying. Many bottle skip this part. So the water is filtered, but your lips touch areas that come in contact with other contaminants . This was a PLUS! Lightweight, but held enough water Comes with a carabiner to hang on backpack No strange taste Rubber bottom to prevent slips (Another review mentioned that it tips over. I did not seem to have that problem. It appears they fixed that issue.) It arrived factory sealed so I knew it was not used Cons: The quality is mediocre. However the flimsy plastic also makes it lightweight. Made in China. Although not desirable, it is difficult to find one not made in China - including the more expensive ones. The deal breaker is that it LEAKS from the top if squeezed at all. It leaked when I drank as well as when I tipped and touched it. I tried multiple times by drying off the the top and tightening. Still leaked. Tried it on other bottle bases that I had at home. Although it was better with mine, it still has a small leak. Another person said that it tips over. I did not seem to have that problem. It appears they fixed that. However, I had to return because of the leak.", "review_title": "leaks", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

The downside is that your product can very easily be overlooked when you're met with a bad experience from a customer service representative. I called their phone number listed here on Amazon because I had lost a glove earlier this year when I moved and figured I would just ask if it was possible to buy only one. I was expecting a no because I understand the costs and measurements could be different between gloves, as the representative let me know, but I wasn't expecting her to be so rude about it. After I had asked I was met with a strong and loud \"NOPE! Nope!\" in more of a condescending manner as if I was asking for another one for free. Then proceeded to try to inform me in a rude way why they can't do that.

One of the main reasons I purchased this was for the massive interactive display. Unfortunately, this screen is the only source of information for your workouts (distance/time) even when not using it for a guided training session. After about 6 uses, the screen would intermittently not capture data from the rower. In other words, I would be rowing - but the distance would not increase or change. Additionally, the rower was continually dropping connection from my network (wireless hub in same room, 15' away, direct line-of-sight.) . This made loading any workout videos or training sessions nearly impossible. Finally, the unit alerted that it required a software update, but upon continuing, the unit became stuck in a constant state of failed-updating. Even when the power was cycled, the unit would return to the failed-update screen. Upon contact with NordicTrack, they directed me to their tech support section - which was less than effective and extremely frustrating to interact with. I quickly decided to return the unit given the problems I had experienced in a short period of owning it. Oh, thats another thing... returning this thing is sort of a pain. I didn't keep the box it came in, so I contacted my local UPS store and talked it through with them. I eventually lugged this thing to them and had to pay $50 for them to construct a box that could package this thing for shipment. It was sort of a puzzle trying to get UPS to accept this, as it is near the max-size they can accept before it's considered freight. I think this unit has massive potential, but the control hub (a.k.a. screen) needs some overhaul and improvements.

Nice size not too little not too big. Holds what you need for an outing. I had a fold up umbrella, sunglasses and case and a few other smaller items in it for the day. Could even fold up a jacket to fit. 2. Nice to have hands free and able to access without taking it off like a backpack. 3. It is comfortable. Wore it all day at a golf tournament and it wasn't heavy and bothersome. I am going to keep it, but would really like it better with the above improvements.", "review_title": "First the things I didn't like: 1", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

First of all, while the description does say that there is no belt included and I can't technically fault them for it, it clearly shows the belt in the photo and the note about the belt is not prominent, so I was surprised when it wasn't included. Also, the photo shows the shoulders strap at their full length, which is unrealistic. When adjusted, the straps hang down in a way that, again, makes perfect sense, but as I bought this for a costume, surprised me when I put it on. Finally, as I began to adjust the straps, I could already see that the teeth that hold the straps in place where starting to fray the straps themselves, under normal use. overall.

The lid cap and gasket tends to mold easily. Although you can take the gasket out to clean it, the lid has too many nooks and crannies that are too small to properly clean. Given how hard it is to clean, I don't think this bottle is worth the high price. I threw mine away and moved on to a more convenient bottle. The concept of this bottle is great, but the execution of the lid leaves much to be desired. Revised review: I originally gave this product a low rating (see original review below). The company reached out to me and was very helpful. Turns out you can use a dull object, like a fork, to pop the silicone gasket out, which then makes the gasket and the lid easier to clean. Thus, I revised my rating from 1 star to 5 stars. Original review: I've had this bottle for more than 6 months now. The lid has your standard silicone ring deep inside it. I stored Gatorade in the bottle and the lid ring molded. The cap is simply too small to clean - I tried using small toothbrushes and other small brushes, but nothing can clean the mold out. The design is nice, but it holds less liquid than advertised.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out my purple watch came with an extra black band. Weirdly enough, I also ordered a black one for my partner, but he didn\u2019t get an extra band. It synced easily to my phone but not to my partner\u2019s phone. What it tracks is very basic and not always accurate. The sleep tracker on my watch was completely inaccurate but accurate for my partner. It doesn\u2019t immediately start counting steps, and from what I can tell it only tracks active calories and not daily total calories. This morning I felt it vibrate unexpectedly. I looked down and it had reset to factory settings! 10 minutes later, it had the right date and time, but all of my activity had disappeared. I give this tracker 3 stars because of the price. You get what you pay for. It\u2019s basic. Mostly accurate. A few glitches. But for somebody on a budget it will do just fine.

Based on my experience, and for the price, I'd ordinarily give 5 stars. However, one of the two sleeves quickly stretched out along the seam, and is noticeable less effective and likely to slip.

The steel is of course a soft steel, I tapped the tip of the blade on the table and it rounded out the tip. But it's easy to sharpen this type of steel. The sheath smells like old boot leather, but it's a solid sheath. The snaps haven't fallen apart yet on me and it holds the blade securely even without the snaps on. The brass on the hilt and pommel wasn't polished at all out of the box, it looked terrible. I ended up polishing it myself, took just a few minutes. The blade seems to chop and bite the wood well sometimes. No nicks or chipping on the blade yet. I think the blade is worth its value. This is a good blade to start off with, so you can learn how to sharpen and baton wood, take it camping...etc. As someone stated in a review, it's a good beater.

Well, I can easily measure the 52 part, and that's clearly not right --- it's about 40 mm looking into the large lense. So I tend to believe the other reviews that say that you're not getting 16x magnification either. Still, so long as you understand the size and weight of the thing, I think it's good for the price. Size: just under 6\" long, outer diameter at widest point about 2\", case is roughly 6\" x 2-1/2\" wide by 2\" 'deep'. Weight: 8 oz even for the monocular, 8.7 oz in the included case. My big beef with this --- why I give it 3 stars rather than 4 --- is that the very first time I tried to use it was in kayaking. I put a strap from my life vest through the belt loop and as soon as I stood up it immediately fell to the ground. The stitching on the belt loop was that poor that it immediately failed as soon as the weight of the item was put on the stitching. So for quality control I'd give them a minus 5 stars. I really want a reliable attachment loop so will fiddle with a small needle to try to hand stitch it in place working sort of inside the item --- what a (needless) hassle. More to the point, I'm fortunate that it didn't fall off and into the water while I was kayaking.

The overall look of it wasn't super eye catching but we are big golf fans here so the simple design and logo are still appealing to us. (wish it would be available in multiple colors, though) The lid was easy to take on and off. The part of the lid that you can open and close was great! It closed completely and securely which was much appreciated! No leaks! Most importantly, the tumbler kept my coffee hot for a much longer period of time than any mugs that I currently own. This will be great for the cold winter months! The size was just right and it fit in my vehicle's cup holder without any issues. I'm excited to try it for cold beverages, too, just to see if it can out perform the tumblers that I was previously using. My only real complaint is that it's not dishwasher safe. I know it's a higher quality tumbler and made of stainless steel but it can be a pain to have to hand wash at times; especially when I'm in a hurry!

I was a bit hesitant on purchasing this light, but for the price, figured I could just return it if it didn\u2019t work as advertised. 1: The install was so simple that it took me a few minutes to figure out. I assumed it was a lot harder than what it was and kept overthinking the install. 2: My eyes! This light is BRIGHT! To me, this light is perfect for your low light/no light scenarios. It\u2019s bright, but not too bright. 3: Beam Me Up! The green laser on this light is pretty awesome, says my cat. I love the fact that I can have both the light and laser on at the same time. With minor adjustments with the provided tool, your laser and light will be as accurate as your shot. The reason for my 4 stars: The light and laser button are slightly difficult to differentiate/operate while holding your firearm with a proper grip. Maybe this is something that you just have to practice with and it becomes muscle memory. Another thing, if this is going on a firearm that you plan to carry, good luck finding a holster. You\u2019ll have to use a universal nylon holster of some sort or have a custom holster made. If you\u2019re using this for training or don\u2019t require a nice IWB/OWB holster, you won\u2019t face this issue. In summary, this light does what it\u2019s designed to do, and it does it well.

It allowed me to carry on conversations while others were shooting, listen to instruction, hear the timer beep and respond to any commands. I needed to increase the volume to accomplish this which does reduce the noise protections somewhat. Because of the increased volume I was hearing funny sound when others were shooting but I did not have wind noise. I talked to the Walkers Company and indicated the increase sound level was probably causing the strange noises. What I was using before cut off all hearing so this was a great upgrade.

I switched to another metal style mesh band that didn't have a magnet and that solved the problem with the analog components not keeping time with the digital component. Review upgraded to 4 starts. (Original review below) I really do want to love this watch. After having owned FitBit trackers for years, I was looking for something different. The HR Sport appealed to me because of the Hybrid setup and the fact that it has a very long battery life, coupled with GPS tracking. The fitness tracking part seems to be spot on, and the App is easy to use, but there are some serious issues with the Analog display. First of all, the Analog display will gradually drift farther away from the digital time display at a rate of about 1 minute a day. I tried factory resets and software updates, but the same thing happens. Same goes for the hour hand. It seems to be slow and starts falling behind. There is also another issue with the small goal completion dial in the bottom. First thing in the morning it will say that I am 95% done with my goals for the day even though my step goal is 10K and the digital display says I have only done 23 steps. It seems like it does not reset back to 0, or, it has the same problem as the analog time hands, and just loses its place gradually. Hopefully they can fix the problem, because I really do like the watch. So with that said, buyer beware. If they fix the problem I will post an updated review.", "review_title": "**UPDATED REVIEW**Digital and Analog time do not match up.

I bought for my wife to use with an inexpensive youth compound 25# bow. They work great, but required some setup: 1. The nocks are not glued in place, but are very tight in the shaft. You will need to align them for your bow setup. For me, this meant setting the index (white) fletching outward away from the arrow rest. You simply need to grasp the nock with a small pair of pliers, and grasp the arrow shaft near the nock and twist to the correct position. 2. The nocks were too loose on my bow's string. You can carefully soften the plastic over a candle flame and squeeze the tips together with pliers or your fingers (Be careful not to burn yourself.) If you get the plastic hot enough to burn yourself, it is hotter than it needs to be. But it is easy to get it too hot, ruin the nock, and burn yourself! Alternatively, you could replace the nocks with a smaller size and avoid the flames. I chose to play with fire and am very happy with the results. Please don't burn yourself, and if you are a minor, do this only with adult supervision. These arrows are light, well made, and fly very well with the 100 gr points and 3\" fletching. The screw-in points meet flush with the shafts, so these arrows will not catch on your target when you go to extract them. This is a very important upgrade over the really cheap target arrows with glued on field points! Plus you could potentially change points and use these for small game. Enjoy.", "review_title": "Great, economical target arrows.", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

Perfect size for iphone 6 plus, by the way. The material is more of a cotton feel, than spandex. I think all workout leggings should have side pockets, for phones and small essentials, which is why I bought these. For the price, I'm happy with them. They aren't the best pocketed leggings I own (which are the Saucony bullet capris/tights, btw. Those are super comfy, stay up with the phone in the pocket, and are more spandexy/moisture wicking), but for the price I can't complain.

I am very pleased with this purchase. The band improves the look of the fitbit significantly, it is also so much easier to use than the other 2 types I have tried. The original band was always a task to fasten and it had an awful smell. The 2nd band would not remain clipped to the side of my fitbit and the watch fell off. Thankfully, I heard it when it fell. I have had this new band for about a week and the magnet has gotten weaker so it doesn't stay snug but I still prefer it to the original band as it never falls off and doesn't stink.

The only negative is that the spongy cushions probably will separate as I use this case over time. Not really a biggy because I probably can buy replacement cushion sponge from the local home store. The case is heavy, made of a sturdy plastic. I have not used the locks yet so I can't comment on them.

I have had the board for 14 days now and I have used it for an hour per day (rotating it every 2 days). Pros -thin wire. I have not had a single bounce out yet (due to hitting the wire) which is the main reason I purchased a new board. Cons -the right side of the board is very loose. When I hit the 17, 2, 15, 10, 6, or 13 (in original orientation) the dart sinks up to the barrel into the board. This makes me question how well the board will hold up in this area. -the bull is very tight. When I hit the bull the dart barely sticks out of it. That said, I have never actually had an issue with a bounce out here even when getting 2 double bulls. It is just a concern that it seems likely to happen. -there are hard shiny spots in most of the Trebles. It doesn't appear to effect the dart going in, just aesthetic -small bur in the spider between the 11 and 8. This could probably cause a bounce out if I hit it, but I haven't yet While this is more cons than pros, I really do like the board and I'm happy with my purchase. None of the cons have really changed my game yet so they aren't really much to complain about. Another thing to point out is that the board did not come with the tack nails to attach the rubber feet to the back. This didn't bother me as I had purchased another mounting system for the board anyway. All in all it is a great board. For the price I am pretty happy. I would definatly purchase this board again because I'm sure that every board is a little different and the next board may not have any of these issues.", "review_title": "No more bounce outs!", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

Overall, it seems well made. One commentator mentioned that the pistol retention snap was worthless and he was correct. It is so weak that it immediately disconnects when putting on pants over the holster. He said he replaced the snap with one that works. Because the holster seems like it is good in all other respects, I have just ordered a snap kit to replace the original snap so the pistol will be properly secured. I assume that once the snap is replaced the holster will work out quite well. If you purchase a holster, you made be able to find a craft person, seamstress, leather worker, etc. who can replace the snap for you if you don't want to try to replace it yourself. The snap is about 7/16\" or 12 mm if you plan to buy a snap repair kit. As another commentator mentioned, it seems like the real problem is that the strap that goes over the back of the pistol is too short and doesn't allow the end of the retaining strap to lay flat against the pistol. this makes it easy for the strap to catch on a pant leg and snap open. When i get my snap kit I will probably just make a new retaining strap sewn to the holster so that it goes completely over the back of the pistol and lays flat against the firearm. As built now, you can see from the picture of the product, the pull tab to release the snap sticks out 90 degrees from the leg making it very easy for the snap to open. Since I am a tradesman, it's not a big deal to me to make these modifications but it might be for others.

Here's my take, if you want a weekend getaway kind of bag, this is not the bag for you. Although it's duffle bag in appearance, that's not it's function. I got this bag to keep in my car to hold emergency supplies. So it has a flashlight, Gerber multi-tool, some paracord, small crank weather radio, bandage sheers, quick clot, gauze wrap, little packets of antiseptic and such, emergency blanket 2-pack, disposable poncho, and an extra pair of socks. It holds all of this and could still pack more in. It's not going to save me from every eventuality but it's a little something that could help me out in the case of an accident and it has straps that function either as a shoulder bag or a fanny pack so I can take it on the go if I had to walk a ways for help. In this capacity, this bag is a very worthwhile purchase. The reason it got 4 stars instead of 5: the zippers. Right now, brand new out of the packaging, the zippers are super stiff. I'm sure that with use they will loosen up and get easier but I don't know that for a fact. I've also seen other reviews that said their zippers broke easily. I could see that being the case with continuous use, but in the capacity of a bag in the trunk to use in an emergency and not for every day wear this bag will do just fine.", "review_title": "It's my emergency catchall and I love it.", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

I wish I had a good work bench to mount this to because I did sets of sights holding it in my hands; yes it can be done! I gave this four out of five stars only because of two things. 1. Does the handle bar slide left and right, because it didn\u2019t for me (maybe I should have tried harder). This exacerbated the issue of me needing the pusher to be further in to rotate the handle. 2. Needing a bit more height on the rear sight mover and possibly a deeper mover. To explain, I was mounting rear sights onto a red dot plate , this was only slightly problematic. Once I had those mounted I needed to mount the plate to the pistol. First, I needed to have the pusher only engage the plate, not the sights which are suppressor height (needing more depth or height in the pusher). The height of the pusher negated me mounting the plate properly and I had to remove the slide and manually mount. Perhaps mounting the plate first would have been more workable but I was using the already mounted sights as a point of reference. One other thing to add, perhaps tick marks on the pusher instead of just on the frame (they are small and harder for me to reference than if they were on both to help with centering).

The knife arrived earlier than anticipated and in perfect condition. I wasn\u2019t sure what the finish would look like based on their own description of the treating process but the one I got is really well done with no blemishes. I watched some reviews where people thought the blade had corrosion already on it out of the box. Is not corrosion just the treatment process. I tested the sharpness on some paper and found the main cutting edge to be not quite as sharp as the other two which are scary sharp. A few seconds on my ceramic sticks and leather strop and the main blade was equal to the others so no complaints there. The sheath seems to be decent quality and has excellent retention with no rattle so I\u2019m really happy about that. It kinda helps with the perception of quality however the giant mercenary tactical banner on the blade somewhat negates that if that makes any sense. As far as durability I really don\u2019t plan on abusing it to find out so I really can\u2019t comment. I honestly bought it because the reviews are good and I like the looks of it aside from the aforementioned logo. The knife Is definitely mini in size but fits my smaller hands well.

My new jump rope arrived within 2 days. Additional Note: I would recommend this jump rope for indoors. My experience was on concrete (rough surface at a park) not over a smooth surface. The primary reason for increasing the rating one Star was due to the prompt reply and fast delivery. ORIGINAL FEEDBACK: I bought this jump rope exclusively because I read it is also for concrete. I do not have anywhere I can jump indoors. I understand that over time this will wear, however it began scuffing after only 10 min. of jumping. I am hoping Fitness Factor will respond on one of my posts because I just bought this rope and only used it 2x. I would like Fitness Factor to send me beads (as they mentioned in another review), since I do not want to spend any more money. For me, $14 is more than my budget allows for.

I am able to walk for miles while watching tv and I have started running on it and have not gotten any complaints from my downstairs neighbors. I even have wood floors and did not use a pad underneath the machine. I was also able to assemble the machine by myself in around 20-30 minutes.

I have had it about 2 weeks now and have used it with real clubs known distances and inside on big tv. First inside with the pratice club that comes with the device takes some getting use to. It is easy to pair with my phone and took me about 2 minutes to set it up. Very user friendly. As far as true yardages inside with the pratice club. The pratice club is weighed to a 7 iron my normal 7 iron Carrie's in the air 158 with a regular swing. With the pratice club inside I average 128 which is very different from my true yardage. The device is pretty true on ball flight as far as open or closed face. Now to real clubs again my 7 iron average stock swing is 158 yards. With the device on my real club it shows I am hitting it a average of 141 which is closer but still a large gap. On the driver my average drive carry is about 240 to 250 the device shows it at 216 carry. Again the ball flight with the clubs and pratice club is pretty true. My overall take it is fun, gives some feedback on club face angle and at least has you swinging a club. Especially at night or weekend to play a few holes when you can't go play. I would have given 5 stars if the yardages were closer to true yardages I hit. But for the price and entertainment level for me I am happy with it for what I am looking for.

I love it. I live in a very hot climate, and being able to spray myself to cool down is really useful to me when I'm walking outside during the day. The bottle's cap is easy to unscrew or fasten, and seems sturdy. There are a lot of high-end water bottles that are available today that use rubbery finishes to achieve a high-end look. This water bottle cap is made of plastic that has the look and feel of a more low-end or low-quality plastic. The translucent plastic that is used to make the bottle/container portion seems fine, though, but the cap could be helped by being made out of higher quality, more modern plastics, or perhaps with a more confidence-inspiring rubbery coating. I guess what I'm saying is that the cap seems like it's from one of those water bottles that are given out for free as promotional items, whereas the bottle/container itself doesn't look cheap at all, but rather looks normal. Anyways, I'd definitely buy this bottle again just for the spray function. It shoots a fine mist and is great on hot days when you want to cool down without getting all sweaty. This bottle will work well for people in hot climates, or for those who like the outdoors.

He is extremely active and enjoy watching basketball but is too little yet to play the real thing, so we felt this would be a wonder introduction to the sport for him. My husband spent about 30 minutes to put the basketball hoop set together. He grumbled as he took one look at the instruction and basically tossed it in the recycling bin. He emphasized that the instructions were incorrect and misleading and probably would have put it together faster without looking at them at all. The instruction is not clear; there were only 4 steps with a few pictures, however the photo's did not come with any meaningful instructions. Besides that, the first photo was misleading as it showed the black screws for backboard but it's actually goes with the pole so it's very confusing. Instructions aside, the basketball stand set is light weight and easy to move around and compact so it doesn't take up so much space which is perfect inside the house. Another feature that I liked is the fact that the height is adjustable which means, my son can continue to use it as he grows! (Please note that you don't have to use all the rods to achieve maximum height). One little bonus is that the package comes with 2 different sizes of basketballs as advertised. Overall, this adjustable basketball hoop stand set is great for toddler.

Found the second one I tried loose. the rest were so tight I messed up a tiny torx driver. These are really nice knives for the price but I wish the manufacturer would make sure the screws are tight from the factory. Would have been 5 stars if all screws were tight. If you're at all handy with tools, I would recommend putting some locktite on all screws you can get to.

This unit is VERY well engineered and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone who wants to track fitness, sleep, heart rate, etc. on a regular basis during the day. The fitness application is very helpful during physical activity with the active heart rate tracking and flashing color code designating heart rate zone. Allows you to quickly see color without focusing/looking at actual numbers. Positives: - Full size USB located on end of device allows charging without any adapter. How many times have you not been able to charge when your band charger adapter is not available? Just use any phone or tablet charger or computer usb outlet. Just release one side of band and USB end is available for charging. -Color display is amazing being large enough and bright enough to see in all lighting conditions with a quick glance. - Color display automatically adjusts to light conditions so brighter in day...muted after dark. - Activity tracker - Band is very comfortable Negatives: - Have experienced several episodes of Bluetooth becoming un synced with phone. Usually requires a quick re connect in phone settings if it does not automatically re connect. However, have had to reboot phone a few times to resync. - 5 day battery is nice and very much within norm for the amount of functions that this band provides but a full 7 day battery life would be better.

I couldn't justify the price at the time, so I just waited. Then when it dropped down to around $10 I bit! Have really enjoyed it and it came quite sharp already, however, two things keep me from giving it 5 stars: 1). It is a spring assisted release and therefore has the rotation point along the main screw in the center (clearly visible in the picture). Since it is under pressure and opening/closing it produces vibrations, the center screw began getting looser after maybe 50-100 times opening and closing it. This screw loosening has caused the blade to wobble in the open position. Isn't a major deal, but better-made knives have a sleeve/bearing of sorts to keep from having the screw loosen (See Kershaw assisted release; I have one and love it). This can be remedied by tightening the star head screw, but it will just get loose again after another 50-100 opens. 2). The pocket clip on the back of the knife is somewhat challenging to open up and clip to your pocket. It holds great once it's in there, but it sometimes takes two hands to reattach it. Mainly a product of the whole knife being so tiny. Besides these two issues/annoyances, this knife is great and has generated a ton of laughs and smiles when I show it!! I really do enjoy having it around because it is quite unbecoming and opens Amazon boxes like a charm.

All the pieces are heavy duty and well-made. I used this to set up a lat-pull station in our back yard for my son. We have loaded it with up to 100 lbs. of weight and have had no problems. Two things to be aware of: \u2022 The eyebolt on the pulley is not secured, so it can unscrew if the pulley is swiveled around several times. My son learned this the hard way. He was hanging from it and spinning (which he should NOT have been doing) and the pulley unscrewed itself and fell. Ideally, there should be a lock nut or washer on the eyebolt to prevent this from happening. \u2022 The cable is shorter than I would like. I was hoping to run the cable through a second pulley so there's some distance between the user and the weights. But it's only long enough to go through one pulley, which means you have to pull at a slight angle rather than straight down. These aren't major issues, and we're happy with our DIY home pull-down station.", "review_title": "Solid unit, watch the eye bolt screw, short cable", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

I found that installation required trimming the mounting screws so they didn't lever the base up at the rear.(Glock 17 MOS) Once that was done I took it to the range to sight it in. You need a sight tool and a set of suppressor height sights to make this co-witness. Design flaw 1. Access to the sight lock is only available with the rear sight removed. I sighted the gun in with the sights and once I had it dialed in I took the rear sight off and set the lock screws then re-installed the rear sight. I shot a few more shots to verify it was still on and it wasn't. I don't know if it creeped or what. I took the rear sight off re-zeroed the Viper and locked the screws again. I put it all back together and still it seemed like it had moved but not as bad. I'm going to use the sight for a couple more months then redo my review. The other design flaw is the requirement of taking the sight off to change the battery and re-zeroing it all over again. The dot is way bright very visible in bright sunlight to the point that it makes the dot large and blurry. But its easily fixed by turning down the intensity. Once the intensity is set it stays there when you power it off and on. It has an auto shut off that I have used several times because I forgot and left it on when I re-cased the gun. When I turn it off I put the cover on the sight to keep it from being scratched. Some observations on the sights. It's fine for range work and competition but this is not for defensive carry. With the fact that it requires pressing a button prior to use and the auto off feature I can't recommend this for that purpose. The difficulty in replacing batteries also makes it a bad choice. The sight glass it fantastic. Its clear and big so picking up the red dot is easy with practice. I thought I would be able to pull it up and find the red dot quick. Not so much, but it's not the sights fault. I need to build that familiarization with the sight before I did any quick gun work. Having used an EoTech on a rifle for the last 10 years i thought it would be like that but it requires a different set of skills.

It's sturdy, smooth, and so quiet. The way that the handlebars and seat adjust horizontally and vertically made it really easy to get a perfect fit for me. Assembly was free when I ordered my bike, so I had it professionally assembled. Since it doesn't have an onboard computer, I bought a Wahoo cadence sensor, and mounted that to the pedal crank arm. I also bought the Wahoo RPM sensor, but can't figure out how to mount it on this bike. I bought the Sunny tablet/phone holder so I could use the Wahoo app and a popular indoor cycling app. Because I use two apps when I cycle and monitoring cadence is important, I spend most of the time with the Wahoo app displayed on my screen, and just have to listen to the indoor cycling app. I'm debating about buying a more elaborate computer to add to the bike (in place of the Wahoo sensors).", "review_title": "Love this bike, but wish it came with a computer to measure cadence, resistance and output", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

I really like this light and its 3 settings, especially the lowest setting which is the only intensity I use when around camp. The medium setting is plenty sufficient to night hike with while still saving a little bit of battery life compared to the high setting. As little as I use a light at camp, this seemed like the perfect solution. The flashlight body is built well and the button on the rear of the light has a very solid action. On the first press, the light turns on in the medium intensity setting. You then double-click the button to cycle through to the high and then the low setting. I would prefer that it always comes on in the lowest setting first, as it's what I use the most because it's so battery-efficient while being enough light to see around camp. My main reason for removing a star is because of the clip. It fits well in the forward-facing position that it arrives in, but I bought this light to clip it to the bill of my hiking hat en lieu of a headlamp. When the clip is turned around, it doesn't seat as well and I have to be careful when clipping it to my hat so it doesn't fall off of the light. Minor issue that can be solved by either being careful or by securing it with a small amount of epoxy. Overall I really like this light as a replacement to using a headlamp. If you're very efficient with your light usage, a single AAA will last for a few nights worth of light use. I still carry a spare AAA battery in my kit though, just in case. This flashlight, combined with an AAA battery inside and a spare battery, still weighs an ounce less than my headlamp did. While my headlamp could last up to 12 hours on high setting, it was just overkill for me.", "review_title": "Ultralight backpacking light", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

Before buying new Halos, I thought I would try these fabric sweatbands -- the much lower price made it worth the risk. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, the sweatbands really work, and work well! I use them for (fast, long-distance) bicycling and for playing Ultimate Frisbee. In both cases, they really do prevent sweat from running down my face and into my eyes. Apparently the fabric really does its job as advertised and evaporates the heat quickly. I have been wearing these in very humid weather with temperatures in the 80's. I certainly DO recommend giving these a try (for far less money). My only \"knock\" is the smallish knot on the band that has to be positioned just above or below my cycling helmet strap -- otherwise it becomes an uncomfortable pressure point, but that's a very small consolation.", "review_title": "Very pleasantly Surprised!!

I do a lot of backpacking and have some lighter versions of this chair, but I needed something for the everyday use and didn't want to beat up my other lighter versions. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED! At just about 2 lbs and a packable size to put inside a pack or bag...I can take this anywhere without the burden of bulky heavier chairs to lug around while I'm the Sherpa for all of the other sports/beach gear! This chair has super sturdy lightweight poles and backing much like something you might find at REI but for almost half the price! The extra bonus kicker is the ground mat that the legs go into if you're sitting in sand or snow. I recently did a trip to MT in July and camped in the snow...this chair would have solved the problem of the legs sinking into the snow causing a very unbalanced or near impossible sitting. I used this at the beach this last weekend while fishing and had zero issues of feet sinking into the sand and was very easy to set up. They included another great feature like pull tabs to help get the poles into the backing and ground mat. Great idea and a very comfortable chair!

I don't want to buy an expensive band, and it's important to decide which one is best for you. In the previous band, I was having trouble syncing to my mobile phone. The battery lasted for one day and the reading was not accurate. This fitness band surpassed all the other bands I bought. The first time you connect to the phone and set it up, no problem. Very easy to use and easy to use. I received the watch on Monday night and it is still going on - surprisingly he has been running for 7 days, can monitor my heart rate and sleep, I can use fitness elements; exercise, walk and bike. I found this watch to be very reliable, especially when I was working at school, now I don't need to worry about the battery affecting me.

Take the time to center the magnet as close to center of the barrel as possible. It works best to approach the magnet base to the muzzle end of the barrel, from a 90 degree angle, slowly letting it come to rest flat. For me, it made it easier to center the magnet on the first try with a little film of gun oil to help prevent any possible scratches. Make sure base of magnet and barrel end are clean. For first use, I would compare it to placing a quarter over the top of a dime. Centering the magnet as close as possible to the muzzle end. I just eye balled it best I can. That's all you need to do. It works as advertised. You don't need to center this device perfectly. You don't need a lot of little parts that get worn out or lost. This laser (green) projects perfect on target at 25 yards and farther depending on light conditions. makes it simple to put the scope's crosshairs on the green dot. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this particular Bore Sighter. What convinced me to go with this one included the Issues from other type tools that insert into the muzzle that users then complained about replacing or losing guides and rubber gaskets made me consider this one over that other type. Considering the price, it seemed to be the best option for me. Price, Great Reviews, and it functions as advertised. It puts you on target quickly, and you don't lose or need to replace little necessary parts.

I used to have back pain doing certain activities, and while I still struggle with it from time to time I've noticed I can work a lot longer before I start encountering pain; for example, leaning over the counter to prepare dinner, or walking/being on my feet for long periods of time.

They don't make this very clear, but when they list the sizes in the descriptions, you're supposed to be measuring from knuckle to knuckle (across our 4 fingers). (2) There are two very different styles of glove you can buy on this page. I first ordered the wrong size (per above); the L wasn't available in the same color so randomly picked black/yellow, but that color combination is a completely different glove than every other one available on this page. You can tell that in the next picture, but I didn't assume the 'color difference' also resulted in a completely different glove.

It's a relatively low power model, especially compared to the stinger but from what i've heard these are some pretty solid beginner guns for the price and they seem quite well. We've been firing both for at least 500+ shots so far, and aside from a few incidents learning the gun it only jammed a few times in the beginning when we'd accidentally pull the lever back twice and we found out it was loading another bb each time. Once we found that out, and just pulled it back a single time we've rarely had a problem. The magazine on this, carries 20 shots, in a little reservoir you have to manually load each BB in one at a time, it's a little finnicky but we've timed ourselves and a reload takes about 40-60 seconds to take out the clip, pull out the bbs, and begin loading them in manually until the clip is full. However while it's slower then the Stinger, it's much more reliable than the Taurus which can be reloaded in seconds but has a tendency to misfire and shoot the bbs everywhere due to it having a highly sensitive 'release'. My younger brother was able to use this fine and snipe a can from our whole backyard. Although compared to the other, it's much more sensitive to the wind and low powered, it's perfect for starting out and is highly reliable and rarely jams which can be a pro or con. For reference, we made a target out of the box this shipped in, point blank this gun will leave a bb deep welt on a can, but not penetrate, and will dent the cardboard box it came in, but not penetrate (about an eighth a inch i'd figure, about the thickness of a quarter), while the stinger pistol we got will rip through cans point blank even with airsoft plastic bbs and leave the same sized welt from 20 feet away. We actually had a problem with the Stinger ripping holes through the cardboard boxes we'd been setting targets across going clean through both ends even when fired 40 feet away from our whole backyard's length.", "review_title": "Reliable, easy to use airsoft pistol.", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

Thus far I have been very impressed. It was packaged very compactly and appears to fold down easily for storage or travel purposes. It appears significantly higher quality than your regular run-of-the-mill drawstring as the straps are firmly attached and will not untie like regular ones do - further they have buckles for length and comfort adjustment. The size capacity also appears to be very generous - I am easily able to fit a towel as well as other beach items inside without issue. The waterproof compartment at the bottom is excellent, and easily fits my US > 10 size shoes. I'm sure it would make a great use for packing a lunch or picnic items. The zipper straps are also very colorful and of a well-suited color scheme. If I were to lose this bag I would definitely choose to purchase it again, as it has performed its duty well thus far. Will update this review if anything changes but it seems like it will hold up well to usage and the weather!", "review_title": "Fantastic Quality Waterproof Drawstring", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}
