It is low and it tends to push your breast toward the center which causes a bulge. I like the back support and I think it will be more comfortable after I get used to it. Will wear for a week before deciding if I will keep it.

The top is a vibrant, bright pink, and the bottoms are white with specs of the same bright pink as well as other bright colors that compliment the top. My favorite thing about this swimsuit is that the top has scallops on the bottom of it which I did not notice when ordering initially. Now, the reason for my three star rating...the cup shaped padding in the top doesn't stay in place, therefore leaving your nipples exposed if the swimsuit is wet. I am not rating the suit on support since I didn't buy it with the intention of it being supportive. I'm blessed up top and do not expect for something with zero underwire to hold me up. The straps do help keep me from falling out of the top though which was one of the reasons I picked it. The bottoms are too big for me but that's only because I have to go up in size for the top to fit, so I really cannot say anything other than they're extremely cute and look like they would be flattering since they're a high waisted fit. (Note: I would have given the swimsuit a lower rating, but I feel like that may be a little premature seeing as how I've had it for less than a week. I will drop a star in my rating if the suit doesn't hold up through the end of summer.)", "review_title": "Cute but see through if not careful!", "language": "en", "product_category": "apparel"}

These bands have generally not lasted much more than a year to a year and a half and you do not want to wear them if you expect to be sweating a lot, or the black comes off on your wrist and the leather straps become stretched. The attached picture shows the straps after just 2 1/2 weeks of wearing...no extreme weather exposure, sweating, etc., and they have already begun to stretch. Also, note that the exterior straps and buckles are different sizes and thicknesses to the center strap and buckle and they are more difficult to thread thru the clasp due to their smaller size.

I hoped they would be the same thickness as tights or stockings, providing a thin layer of cushion and protection without the full bulk of socks. Unfortunately, these are no thicker than pantyhose.

The material is more of a net (like traditional, thin pantyhose) and seems like it will run easily. I certainly would not call these \"stockings.\" However, I will say I was impressed that these stay up fairly well throughout the day without being too tight on your calf.

I ended up ordering the plus size with 36\" length, because I didn't want to have any gaps when moving around. It was more than ample to wrap around - I could wrap the skirts 1-1/2 times around at least! This makes them very secure, but also means that some of the dress configurations aren't very doable with all the extra fabric. I plan to keep them to wear as skirts. I liked two out of the three skirts I got. The third (lighter pink in photos) was of a different type of fabric - more synthetic feeling, and noisy when I moved around. I probably won't wear it for that reason. However I was pleased with the look and feel of the other two. The ties are very long... I might shorten them. I will also reinforce the stitching around the holes in the waistband to strengthen them, as there is just a loose zig-zag stitch. If you are debating between sizes, I did end up ordering a second set of the regular width, and they worked fine for me. The reason is that the skirt is fuller at the bottom, so even though it only overlapped 5\" at the waistband, the overlap further down the skirt was larger.", "review_title": "Nice", "language": "en", "product_category": "apparel"}
