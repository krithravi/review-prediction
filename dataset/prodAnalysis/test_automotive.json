I got this to filter out the sun and shade my baby. It looks good and does its purpose, all the while I am still able to see through my rear view mirror. However, it should be noted, that this does not go down as easy as shown in the video. Most times one side gets stuck on the clip in the headliner and you have to hold the clip so that the shade can come down. Also, I'm not sure if the tab on mine was defective or cheap, but it tore right off from the shade. This surprised me because unless its raining or I'm driving at night I leave it alone. I may have put it up and down a total of 10 to 15 times at the most before it broke. Its more of a pain now to bring up, but I never really used the tab to put it down as the shade would always get stuck in a clip. Pros: -Looks great -Easy to install -Blocks the sun, but you can still see Cons: -Durability -difficulty to put the shade down (you will need to use 2 hands, and in my case I have to use 2 hands now to bring it up as well since the tab broke) I'm not exactly sure I would recommend this product.

I've tried about 9 or 10 different brands and nothing comes even close to these in regards to the lumens produced. Now let's talk about the build quality. Originally, Alla Lighting had these bulbs with thinner connectors (refer to the picture, the bulb on the left) that would constantly break off due to poor soldering. Then Alla introduced the \"New\" version with thicker connectors (refer to the picture) that were supposed to eliminate the breaking off problem, however, as you can see for yourself, it did not work. Overall, I have spent a couple of hundred dollars due to constantly having to replace the failed bulbs. Eventually, I had to switch to a different brand, one with a different connector design (picture on the right), which will never break off, but had to sacrifice on the brightness. I will not purchase anymore of the Alla Lighting T10 bulbs until the connection design is completely changed.", "review_title": "New design, same problem", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

On the phone they quoted their return/refund policy. It was a really nice detailed return policy that covered why they held 50% of the refund. Here's the problem, their return/refund policy was no where on the listing. I even looked again while on the phone with their customer service rep. Nope, not there. It would have really been helpful to know their return policy in advance to buying the item. Update: the seller \"Driver Mods\" kindly sent me a screen print of a pretty basic and non-helpful return policy. It pointed me to Amazon's return policy for Amazon fulfilled items. This was a third party seller and it does not apply. Driver Mods has a VERY specific return/refund policy.

Now I wonder if anybody that purchased this unit ever double-checked the pressure or if I just got a defective unit. None the less I cannot trust this after seeing the performance since I have a road trip in about a week. This unit was easy to understand and easy to set HOWEVER this unit is WAY off pressure. I have a few month old Tesla Model 3 and the TPMS indicated tires were low on pressure. All read about 37 PSI but when I hooked up this unit it read 30 PSI. I was a little skeptical but thought the TPMS sensors could be off. Aired up 2 tires to 42 PSI as indicated on the unit. I think turned on the car and one tire read 49 PSI and the other 46 PSI. I then pulled out the tire pressure gauge and sure enough 49 / 46 PSI when the unit read 42 PSI on both. I then tried another tire subtracting for the 5-7 PSI difference and found when I stopped the PSI on the gauge fluctuated about 2 PSI. This is just not acceptable. You reply on this unit to be correct and not to have to check pressure again. I encourage anybody that purchased this product to double check the pressures.", "review_title": "Guess all the positive reviews never checked the pressure", "language": "en", "product_category": "automotive"}

You can also rotate them 360 degrees and lock them in at various positions which also helped get them at just the right angle. Ratcheting ability really helps to lock the bow in tight and the soft rubber lined fingers haven't marred the finish on my bow at all. Hardware could've been of better quality though.

Fit was less than ideal, in fact I would say poor. The \"wings\" (flat tabs on ends) are too long, in seemingly random order.

Tabs all around the body are too long, leaving the bulge shape appearing to float in the frame, offset and misaligned, leaving portions of the tape exposed. LR does not align level with the LF, giving a staggered appearance.. I've found that this is because the tabs are cut too long and the \"bulge\" is prevented from sitting deeper in the frame opening. All in all, after some sanding of the tab edges, I was able to get them to fit, somewhat, as I believe they were intended. All in all a good buy.

In the main package there were 10 individually packaged wipes, and two pairs of gloves. I thoroughly washed and dried my vehicle prior to applying the Cerakote. I even went as far as to use my air compressor to make sure the surface was completely dry. One thing that I think some people forget to do, is to make sure that the surface they are applying the product to is cool to the touch. I chose a small area of my vehicle to try this on, but one that need to be restored. I carefully applied the Cerakote Trim Coat to the bumper cover, being careful to only get it on the plastic and not on the paint. Applying small, short strokes of the wipe seemed to do the job. Immediately you could see the old dull area become shiny and dark black. Once I was done, and about 30 minutes after application, I took my after pictures. So far it seems like a great product, and I will look this evening to see if anything has changed. I plan to use this next on the inside of the vehicle to liven up some dull, worn out areas.

If you're buying this tool, you probably already know this, but you need to use an old brake pad or something like that to let the tool work against -- this tool will not work well on it's own without the old brake pad to press against. Honestly, if you have a c-clamp already, just use that. And if you don't have one, you can probably find a suitable one at Harbor Freight for half the price of this.

They arrive promptly, they were in good condition and they were easy to put together . A simple install the battery etc. We tried them out quickly, they work fine. Overall we would give them a five star but after a couple of weeks we discovered that the one we used very quickly had it\u2019s icon images on the remote rub off. We suspect that they may have been sitting in a warehouse for a long time and may be degraded and that\u2019s why the logos to lock and unlock, open the trunk, etc were quick to fade. **Warning two other buyers - use these they\u2019re a good bye but keep an eye on this quick fading.

All advertised contents were in the shipment. The primary wiring harness for the light bar was provided but there was no wiring harness for the spotlights. Purchase of additional wiring for the spotlights is necessary. In addition, electrical wiring connectors and zip ties are needed and not included. Installation took two people about two hours. The pre-drilled mounting bracket holes aligned perfectly. The existing screws were removed and were re-used. The light bar works perfectly and casts a very bright white light. There probably are some differences when compared to more expensive lights. However, this particular light is good quality and provides good value for an affordable price.
