You cannot get this seat tight, the latches are merely metal clips that bend too easy, and the base being flimsy only gets worse. My daughter sways in the back the whole time we drive. I\u2019m actually trading this seat in to be recycled and replacing with another Graco. No way in heck this would last long term or in an accident. Not worth the risk! I purchased this seat to compare to a graco 4 ever all in one for quality and also fit. I have a 2014 Chevrolet 1500 crew cab truck, so space is tight from the rear facing seat to the back of the front seat. After having these seats side by side, I have to say the graco is worth every penny. It\u2019s very solid in construction, no wobbling, quality fabrics. The plastics are quite a bit sturdier and not flimsy whatsoever. I don\u2019t have any doubt that the 4 ever seat will last 10 Years. The safety first is a good seat, it\u2019s just not on the level of the graco. The plastics are noticeably thinner, slight wobble, the fabrics are softer but don\u2019t keep their shape (it came with the headrest crumpled up) and are warmer than the graco, something important to keep in mind for our Texas weather. The base on the safety first is narrow and sways on hard floor or car seats no matter how tight the belt is. For being taller in height, I\u2019m surprised to find that the graco fits better in my truck. The safety first takes more room reclined, and has many less recline options. It\u2019s also wider than the graco. Had my daughter not spit up on the safety first as I was testing it, I would return it and get another graco. The difference in price is well worth the quality. When it comes to budget, I just don\u2019t think car safety is the pace to trim dollars. It\u2019s important to note that the graco can serve as a backless booster and handle 20 pounds more. I\u2019m hoping the safety first will last as a secondary seat, but for those shopping for a primary seat, please save your dollars and invest in the 4 ever. My vehicle and my husbands have quite a few safety features that not all vehicles may have, which is the only reason I\u2019m comfortable keeping this seat.", "review_title": "Updated- don\u2019t buy", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

I wanted one that wasn't as bulky as mine, but still had plenty of room to carry enough for 2 kids plus my essentials. I love that it has an extra compartment in the front. Most that I looked at didn't have this. I also really like that you can access the inside from a zipper in the back and has the extra cell phone compartment. (I actually use it for my wallet.) I'm not super impressed with the insulated pockets, though. My kids' milk cups barely fit in them, and it's very hard to zip once they are. The insulation part has also come loose and slides down. Other than that, my only complaint is that I wish the inside liner was a darker color.

So I decided to give it a try. The first several times we used it on our sick 2 year old we noticed the snot coming back up the tube that goes in out mouth, and at least once, we each had it make it all the way without us noticing......YUK. I was about to give up on it all together and order something similar to the one we had when my wife suggested switching the tubes on the bulb, meaning, the tube that fits in the nostril leads to the top of the bulb and the tube that goes in our mouth leads the side. This simple change made the whole thing more like the one we did have and now directs the snot straight down into the bulb instead of toward the tube that leads to the mouth. With that change we have not had any problems with the snot getting into our mouths and we are both much happier with this device.

One was completely broken, and the other feels fragile. I'm scared to actually wear it. It is advertised that it turns when you twist the nobs, but it does not. I would not have bought this in the first place, but it was FALSELY advertised. The description ALSO says it is made of high quality materials. Read between the lines. made WITH good quality materials is NOT THE SAME as having a product that is high quality if the assembly is really bad... Get a cheaper one. It will probably be just as good as this one. I will be returning.", "review_title": "Description lies.", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}
