Following the treatment I soaked my feet nightly as instructed and there was no sign of peeling until day 3-4 but that was to be expected based on the other reviews and instructions. At first I was excited to see the peeling and then it wouldn\u2019t stop. The peels are comping off in small pieces that are getting everywhere! It\u2019s disgusting! On my sheets, in my shoes and socks, on the rug, truly everywhere. It\u2019s so gross. Not to mention my feet look awful. They are all half peeled off with strand of dead skin hanging off that won\u2019t stop even a week later. On a side note, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related or not, but I recently just got the biggest most painful blister on my heel. I think it\u2019s related to the peel mask because maybe it made the skin too thin on the heel and it rubbed it raw. I always wear sneakers without socks and I never got a blister like this until I tried this mask. I think the mask is a great idea and I\u2019m sure if this peeling ever stops that my feet will be the softest they\u2019ve been in years. But right now they are messy and the heel is painful.

I don\u2019t get to wear eyeliner often because either I\u2019m working from home or I have to run out the door. I\u2019ve used this eyeliner about 6 times in the past month and store it the way they stated to - with the felt tip downward. Never left the lid off. It\u2019s starting to be difficult to touch up my winged eyeliner since the tip is drying out so much.

Truth is I NEVER know what I am going to get. The GOOD thing about these wigs is that they have a VERY natural looking texture which is what I LOVE. People always think this is my hair. If they are full and fairly new they are actually quite nice looking. I get the same length most times (18 inches) but the wigs are NEVER there same. If they were consistently good I'd be fine with that, but they are not. Sometimes I get a wig that makes me think I've ordered the wrong thing when taking it out of the box. I JUST received a wig that's so pitiful looking that I will be returning it. I NEVER return things b/c I am lazy, but I refuse to just give away my money. This last wig I got is thin and the top of the wig is 14 inches at best while the very back is 18 inches (what I ordered) . It is not full at all. Usually I add weave hair to these wigs b/c I have a kinky straight bundle purchased from somewhere else a long time ago. But I refuse to waste my time AND bundle trying to make this newest wig acceptable. Especially since these wig only last about a good month before they start shedding and looking like what they cost. Side note: I only use steam rollers on these wigs b/c heat will shorten the lifespan even more AND heat makes them stink VERY badly (even using a low temp AND heat protectant). Also, I don't ever really wear wigs without a bang/side swoop because I have a big five head AND I also I can't be bothered with trying to blend the front with my hairline. I have worn other lace fronts pulled back though, and I don't think these wigs are good for doing that. All in all they are decent wigs that you can easily purchase from Amazon and they don't break the bank so you don't have to try to get months/years out of a dying wig. However, I think I may have to go back to paying a bit more for a decent Italian Yaki/Kinky Straight unit. I am tired of playing a guessing game everytime I get my order. I will attach pics of me in this wig over the last few years or so, just so people can see that these can be decent wigs (in my opinion). The quality and fullness is just not consistent, so MOST times I add hair, and I purchase them a lot more frequently to keep them looking like I like them.", "review_title": "Decent wig but Inconsistent Quality", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that\u2019s right RUST. Perhaps it\u2019s from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn\u2019t bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn\u2019t shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don\u2019t get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot.

If you\u2019re a fan of expensive nail polishes stay away from this product! I\u2019ve ruined two bottles of my favorite nail polish before I realized that it was 100% acetone!", "review_title": "100% acetone is not a nail polish thinner!", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

I received it, opened it and was immediately put off by the smell (smells like straight sake) but I'm not one to get hung up on scents (if it works, it works, regardless of smell). I used it for about a week and I will honestly say my skin felt awsome! Baby smooth and definitely looked more radiant. But after that first week was went it went downhill. Cystic acne started to pop up along my cheekbones. I brushed it off as a period bump (monthly was coming soon) but then I started to get more, on my chin and my forehead. I thought well..they say your skin gets worse before it gets better, so I continued using it. About 2 weeks later my face had completely erupted in cystic acne. I had lumps under my skin from more trying to make their way to the surface, and my face was sensitive to the touch because they were so painful! It took me about a month of using my tried and true products to correct what this product did to my face. I saw a lot of great reviews of this product and I was really hoping i would have the same experience with it (considering my skin is no where near sensitive and the only time I have a pimple is when its close to my monthly), but my skin absolutely hates this!

They are the same thickness across and have almost a yellowish tint to it. Because of that they are far more noticeable than another brand I had. They are fine for around the house or at night, but not great if you plan on wearing them out. The only benefit is the medicine i think goes all the way to the edge so its slightly easier getting the smaller patches to fit over larger pimples, where as the other brand the medicine was in the middle and sometimes Id not get the patch quite centered. The sheets are not perforated so you have to carful pull the patch off with your fingernails and hope you dont mess up the edge. These patches work pretty much like the other brand I bought before. Some times they work over night, sometimes i have to use multiple patches back to back and sometimes they don't work at all, mostly on the deep pimples. Over all these are cheap, you get a lot for your money, they work as well as more the expensive brand I tried but they are harder to peal off the sheets and are more visible.", "review_title": "Not beveled as advertised", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

Simply put, this face wash smells like something you would use to clean your toilet. From reading the description I was expecting a pleasant tea tree smell but it was more reminiscent of Pine Sol than anything else. As for it's other claims, well, it certainly does the job of cleaning and moisturizing but it's reek makes washing your face with it a chore rather than a pleasure. I'm frankly amazed it's even on the market and I'm fully convinced it wouldn't be able to exist without the online market. One sniff of this in a brick and mortar store would end up with the product being hurled into the nearest wastebasket. These guys should really hire a consultant to come up with a pleasing scent - something that doesn't whiff of industrial solvent for example. Couldn't be more disappointed.

This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special.

The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE.

I took the straightener and did a quick curl on one I wasn\u2019t using and it\u2019s curled beautiful with no problem.

To start, I will say I have struggled with cystic acne since I started college at 18. I am now 23 and have tried every product people swore by. However, I try to be as homeopathic as I can. I was absolutely against Proactive solely because of their ingredients. My acne became so bad I figured I didn't have much to loose (expect my beliefs), so I purchased this. I did not expect to work as well it did. My skin instantly looked better after one day (2 uses, morning and night). Not only is acne 98% clear, my complexion and texture is drastically different. I rate is 4 starts instead of 5 because I fear if I stop using the product my skin will resort back to its horrendous state. I don't plan to use this product for the rest of my life, as it can cause underlying problems due to its ingredients. I will continue to use this product, but I also plan on incorporating some sort of antioxidant in my skincare routine.

I used it on my face about 6 times one after another and the amount of white material that formed on my face every time, never lessened. And if it was actually peeling skin off my face, the amount of skin would have been reduced, but it never was. Really disappointed in what looks more like fake advertising, and a fake experience.
