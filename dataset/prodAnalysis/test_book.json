The title of the book is kind of deceiving because it is meant to go through a chapter in about a week. With each chapter, the child should learn how to sound out and blend sounds to make a few words. \"Teach a child to read in one week\" really means to read a FEW words. Each chapter focuses on different letters and how to associate the sound the letter makes with the letter. I was really excited to start this book with my son before he starts kindergarten. I feel there is so much prep-work involved in each chapter, I am discouraged to do more even though this method seems to work. I think it would be beneficial to include a workbook with this book with the information that needs to be copied or printed. The website has a few handouts, but it does not include everything that is recommended to use in this book. I made multiple copies and cut out letters and pictures for just chapter one.

It is a very kid-friendly and age-appropriate way for me to discuss my five year old's origin story with him.

For all intents and purposes she is very much a success. But she realizes there is something missing. The imagery is very sweet. It is an illustration of her with her heart showing and there appears to be a puzzle piece missing. It follows her on her journey to find a donor at the \"bank of hopes and dreams\" and a doctor who can help. The doctor uses the \"donation\" to make a baby on Mommy's belly. In the end mommy has the baby and you see a picture of her heart with the puzzle piece filled in. On the puzzle piece is a picture of a baby. My son loves this story. He calls it, \"the book about me.\" Highly recommend this book to any donor-moms looking to have this conversation with your kids.", "review_title": "My five year old loves this book", "language": "en", "product_category": "book"}

I wish it had a little more of a \"how-to\" emphasis but the urban sketches throughout the book were awesome and are very inspirational. I like the way they are broken down by city. The last section covers different inspiration and topics such as buildings, harbors, seasons, people in action and even night sketching. It was also interesting to read about other urban sketchers and how they go about their art. I only have two complaints that pulled the rating down a star or two. One, the book comes with a paper cover that contains the artwork you see on the book. The actual cover is just light blue with a white band that contains some line art. A little disappointing but not a big deal. The bigger issue is that the book looked like someone had dropped it several times or thrown it around the room. The paper cover was all beat up as was the actual book cover. This is not the fault of the book's author but rather the seller's fault or the way the shipping company (USPS) handled the book. Either way, in my opinion this is unacceptable and kept me from giving the book 4 or 5 stars. I normally would have read the book more thoroughly (I just skimmed it and read some sections) before reviewing the book as I am extremely miffed about the condition of what was supposed to be a new book.

This book is truly AMAZING. I am not a cook as my husband does most of our meals. When I do help in the kitchen I have to follow a recipe to the letter. This book was beyond perfect. It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author.

This is without a doubt the WORST programming book I've ever read. To frame this, I've been programming in some capacity since high school in 1981 and professionally for almost 30 years. So why would I pick up such a book in the first place? Most of my work has been in other languages, primarily Java with a decent amount of C and C# among others. But very little C++, and that little bit was quite early in my career. I thought this might be a handy book to help refresh my memory and fill in the gaps on it's unique properties. Unfortunately I've never read anything so poorly written with so many errors both grammatical and factual. (Kids, don't drink and write!) He starts off saying you don't need to know C, but I feel sorry for anyone trying to use this book who doesn't. Especially because you'll be learning a lot that is bad or just plain wrong and won't realize it. The Q & A sections are worthless. The questions are sloppily written and ambiguous - this is programming, and precision is everything. The format for these is that there is a section with a number of questions, most multiple choice, followed by an answer section where the questions are repeated and the answer highlighted. But FREQUENTLY the repeated version of the question is somewhat different from what was asked in the first place, to the degree that it changes the answer. In the section on switch / case, there is a question to write a bit of code to assign grades using a switch, but the answer is a complete nonsensical mess that would be wholly unacceptable in a first year programming class. And if you're completely new to C / C++, you're going to be totally lost as there are often questions asked about things that haven't even been hinted at in the text to that point. I'm all for challenging readers, especially in books that are meant to teach new concepts. But normally you would at least give pointers to further information or something of the sort. I purchased the Kindle version, and sadly the presentation is nearly as bad as the content. The layout is sloppy with odd font sizes in places and text flowing awkwardly around the code examples. And speaking of the code examples, almost all of them are truncated, losing at least one or two lines at the end of each. Sometimes it's not much of a problem, only losing a closing bracket. But with others you lose enough to miss the whole point of the example. I almost wish I had the print version so I could at least get the satisfaction of burning the horrid thing.", "review_title": "Worst. Programming. Book.

In the same section, the multiple drawings of vaginas are just kind of hanging out there in space, with no legs or feet or hands or bellies or anything else to orient the reader. Once the young teen finds the word \"anus\" in the drawing he or she will eventually be able to figure out up and down, but I've seen car manuals with better directions and illustrations.

Another major point of contention is that the author advises the TOTALL elimination of a staggering amount of ingredients found in modern food despite the fact that its admitted that it is unknown if it is actually harmful. If you think you can do this great for you but I think it is misleading to the public. There is some whisper (and not a scientific one) of a chemical, preservative, or additive in food and it is \"Throw it out. Don't let your child near it.\".

I'm basically trash for stories where the male lead is an unapologetic man slut (but not in a bad way), then fights tooth and nail when confronted with the one woman that makes him actually FEEL, and proceeds to fall head over heels for her. That's definitely the case with Eric and Jean and it has the added bonus of him falling in love with her baby as well! The tension that was created because of the contentious relationship between Eric and Nell (which totally made me want/need to read the first two books in the series to get the background on all of that) and between Jean and her parents elevated the book above standard romance fluff.
