The big flaw here is how your GoPro (etc) mounts. It mounts just fine but you can't properly fit the thumb screw in place. The more you tighten it, the hard it is to tighten because it hits the frame of the light. I can't believe they were able to even sell this the way it is, it's that bad. That said, without enough work (and a screw driver) you can tighten it down but make sure the housing for your GoPro will stay with this light permanently because having to unscrew and re-screw it would be a huge pain. Dedicate a GoPro case/holder/frame/housing (whatever it's called) just to this and it becomes better. The other issue is that the battery doesn't last long. A few hours probably but that's not long. The charger blinks orange and green while charging so you'd think it would turn green when done, right? Nope, blinks orange and green forever regardless. So you just have to charge it for hours or overnight and assume it's fully charged, and hope it is. The light itself is amazing.

We figured we'd get a camera we could monitor from our phones. This has AMAZING picture quality and I can clearly zoom in and see the baby breathing. However, you can't just leave the sound on all the time so you'd know if baby was crying at night and hear them. You have to physically open the app, make sure the sound is on and then you'd know if they're crying. That's a HUGE flaw for me... I'd prefer it continually run in the background so you can hear sound (don't need the picture all the time, just the sound)... I suppose you could possibly leave your phone on all night long and leave it on for sound but I'm sure that's not good for your phone...", "review_title": "Not great for a baby monitor...

Motion detection always triggers and phone is always alerted. Downside is that every time a bird or large insect flies by, or the wind blows a branch, it triggers the motion detection and alerts my phone. So, about 19 out of 20 times I get a motion detection alert on my phone, it's for one of those reasons and NOT because a person came nearby. So, it's decent, and even the two-way audio is OK, though the volume is really low. But it would be so much better if there were a way to adjust sensitivity or only have it trigger when object larger than a bird moved through the detection field of the unit.", "review_title": "Works well, but way too many false positives", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}

It's either a sports camera (as the seller describes it) or potentially a spy camera (it's design makes it less than discreet but people may not be sure what it is). The camera is very well made and it feels like it was designed to survive being dropped and to take a fair amount of abuse. It's also waterproof out of the box which factors into its airtight seal design. There are individual buttons for the camera's various functions to make its operation as simple as possible. Want to take video? Press the video button. Connect to WiFi? Press the LAN button. Want to take a quick picture? Press the photo button. Because the camera does not have a screen any adjustments to the camera's settings must be done using the app. Screen resolution (max 1080p at 30 fps), frequency, exposure, motion detection and a number of other functions are all adjustable. The back of the camera is magnetic so you can attach it to virtually any metal surface. While you can stick to the side of your home appliances, a fire hydrant, etc. I would avoid attaching it to a moving car since it would probably pop off if you hit a pot hole. The camera comes packed with a bunch of useful GoPro compatible mounting accessories as well as a wrist band to wear it like a watch. It makes for a very bulky wrist accessory but if you want the camera readily available without having to dig it out of a bag when you need it kind of makes sense. How is the video quality? It's actually very good and comparable to the $29 Polaroid Cube. With the ability to adjust a number of the default settings image quality can improve quite a bit.

With one button click in- you control the brightness and then the white balance- this helps get very natural looking pictures even in very dark corners.

However, we\u2019ve had it for less than three months and the charging cord for the monitor broke after about one month (luckily it\u2019s universal so easy enough to replace), but now the monitor doesn\u2019t consistently work and turns completely white one and off so while the audio still works for us to hear our daughter, we can\u2019t see her anymore when it\u2019s goes white. Very frustrating...wouldn\u2019t recommend.", "review_title": "Do not recommend", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}

I just saw them on sale for $69 and at that price it is a true bargain, a rare bargain. These arrived and they are the best lights I have ever bought for under $300. Stands, and quality soft boxes and lights. The power is perfect, balanced for daylight and provide stunning color. I have my more pricey LED panel to my son after these arrived as they do better. They even come with a nice carrying case. 5 Stars all the way.", "review_title": "Wow, best lighting deal on Amazon. These are FANTASTIC!", "language": "en", "product_category": "camera"}

I was in a hurry at the time, but as a myopia I couldn\u2019t see the position of my glasses. So, at the moment, I was witty looking for my dad\u2019s endoscope to search for my glasses. It\u2019s really convenient, what I need to do is download the HD SEE app through the QR code, and turn on the wifi box ,connect to the wifi. It\u2019s easy, when I click on the app ,I can see everything under the bed clearly. At last, I got my glasses back.

The tripod itself is okay but I own a iPhone 8+ and it barely held it up.. I assume it would work fine for a go pro... the remote is TRASH .. number one the battery they sent with it I think was to big for the slot because when I finally got it to shut it started to crack along the seam (pic attached) .. I wouldn\u2019t really recommend this product the only reason I haven\u2019t sent it back is because I didn\u2019t really need the remote for what I wanted to do and the tripod worked okay...
