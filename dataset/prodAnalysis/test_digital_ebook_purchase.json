Enoch, a Wisconsin farmer, has his home changed by the aliens to accommodate the inter-galactic travelers, and from the start of his new station-keeper job does not age as long as he in in his home. The plot is not wild or even terribly exciting, but is fascinating and holds the reader like any good page-turner. It was written back in 1963, and I was in high school then, already an avid reader but not reading science fiction yet. It didn't strike me as old-fashioned or out of date, although sleepy farm towns in rural Wisconsin were not usually the stuff of good novels in the 60's or even now. The ending was a bit of a surprise for me, and it even turned a bit preachy, but all the threads of the story were wrapped up and and left me satisfied.

Wouldn't she at least wait until the war is over before assuming he is not coming back to her? After assuming he is dead she quickly falls in love with his best friend who now becomes the love of her life. The character of John, an ex-slave, is also stereotypical and very shallow.

I enjoyed the Violet character and her storyline but it was pretty predictable. Since this book was titled the Secret Life of Violet Grant I wish the whole book had been about her.

When I saw that this book was going to be able two peoples who relationship started over the internet I knew this book was going to be one I was going to love. I love when the foundation of a relationship is set up before the two people even meet, it really forces you to connect with the characters more and be more invested in them and their lives. Ryder was an interesting character. He\u2019s smart and hard working, I felt like he was still trying to prove to his dad that he was going to be ready to take over for him one day, but at the same time he was also having some second thoughts, like he hasn\u2019t really figured out what he wanted to do with his life yet. For someone who is always on the move with people all around him he felt very lonely to me. It wasn\u2019t surprising that he ended up reaching out to a random person online, although the fact that she was a cam girl was a little surprising. I have to say Ryder is just so lovable, he\u2019s kind to Eden, he\u2019s interested in way more than what she does for a living, and when they finally meet the way he is with her and her home life, I mean he couldn\u2019t be any more great. Eden, wow, Eden. I have a lot of respect for her, I know a lot of people look down at people who do things like be a cam girl, but sometimes in life you need money to take care of your family. And frankly she\u2019s amazing at taking care of her family. I loved seeing her and Ryder interact. I was invested in these two, and the chemistry was awesome.

If you are not open to homeopathic healing, this may not be the best book for you. But then again, maybe it will be. This book offers a difference perspective on your health and healing process. It is written in a conversational, but almost thesis-like tone. Examples of the case studies are provided and the personal sentiments of the author are very clearly present. That being said, I appreciated the perspective that was presented. I am not sure I would agree that a cancer patient should ignore their doctor in place of naming their tumor and talking it out of being there. (I actually find that slightly concerning and dangerous.) However, I do believe we are too dependent on medications for a great many things in today\u2019s world and seeking a new means of taking care of simple aches and pains are always intriguing.

The grinding for levels is boring and lacks interesting detail. Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly.

I love the premise - writer that keeps writing events that come true (frankly, this one made me wonder if some of the spying could really be happening). It's hilarious that Ian's antagonists think he's a master spy when it all turns out to be dumb luck. This book was more \"in depth\" than the first one, but nothing that is difficult to follow. I like the relationship that Ian and Margo are building. Laughed out loud at some of the \"President's\" tweets. The book is pure fun. Don't look here if you're wanting your fiction believable, or serious.

Upon arriving in London from Scotland however, she takes a trip to the slums of St. Giles in search of an old childhood friend who might be in trouble... Forced back to London after the death of his brother, Richard, the Earl of Blackthorn, wants only to settle his family debts and fulfill a deathbed promise. Needless to say, rescuing a damsel in distress and finding a wife were not part of the plan. But when danger comes knocking at his fiancee's door he must not only confront his demons, but consider the prospect of opening his soul to the amazing woman who's stolen his heart... I have to admit that I did like this story for the most part, but if you're a stickler for historical accuracy then this one may not be for you. Believability was an issue for me, as well as the fact that a relatively innocent miss was able to trot around Regency England with nary a maid, groom, or any other type of chaperone for the majority of the telling. I also noticed way too many typos, at least forty or more would be my guess. I did like the romance between Amelia and Blackthorn though, and I also liked them as individuals. There were even a few plot twists that included some very sad events, although I didn't feel as emotionally invested as I should have. Overall I think this story could be made better with a little editing, but I do think the author has potential and I'll probably give the next book in this series a try when it comes out.", "review_title": "SINFUL PLEASURES: Sinful Ladies of London Book #1", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

This book, however, was very disappointing. For one thing, I detest books where the characters cannot stand up to their various family members. There are too many books out like this and I'm tired of that particular trope. I also wasn't enamored of any of the characters. I especially disliked Abby who kept throwing her brother under the bus and, despite her obvious intelligence, was a dithering female and acted like a prima donna. I liked Darcy, who seemed to be the only one in the whole book that was trying to make things work. The whole story seemed sort of rushed. I'm not familiar with Meredith Russell so can't comment on her skills, but this was not at all one of RJ Scott's best efforts. Not a very good start to this new series.", "review_title": "Very disappointing", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

That said, I'm a little disappointed in Criminal. It's well written for sure -- BUT I didn't care for the jumping back and forth from present to past to present again, and that with little clarity for the reason behind it until much later in the story. I admit I almost lost interest and nearly quit a quarter of the way through the book. I told myself it had to get better because it's a Karin Slaughter book, for goodness sake! So I kept reading, and it did indeed pick up considerably half way through. However, even then there were a few annoying things that I largely ignored, one of them being the silly notion that one of \"the girls\" was a virgin because detectives found a box of tampons among their meager possessions. Really, Karin Slaughter? Twelve, thirteen, and fourteen year old virgin girls have been using tampons since they were first put on the market ages ago. Note to author and others who may not know: tampons aren't what causes a girl (or woman) to lose her virginity. I know the book is fiction, and the writer can dream up whatever, but that virgin-tampon thing was ridiculously absurd. However, once the story (finally) started to unfold, it turned into an interesting, exciting read. I was actually eager to finish it. So despite what I thought was a somewhat muddled beginning with a few quirks along the way, I enjoyed it and recommend it to others. There's also a bonus short story at the end of Criminal called Snatched. It was better than the book itself, and it's classic Karin Slaughter cleverness. Bravo! Well done! Of course I will continue to read Karin Slaughter books, and I do like poor ole Will Trent. I look forward to reading a more of his cases.", "review_title": "Mixed reaction", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

It\u2019s awkward and pointless; I kept hoping there would be some big moment in the novel where it made sense, to no avail. Thankfully, the actual book far surpassed the cover art. The Naked Truth was fun and flirty, peppered with enough heavy subject matter to keep me invested in Layla and Gray\u2019s story. Layla and Gray were both fabulously strong characters. I found Gray\u2019s raw honesty and commitment to never lie to Layla refreshing in a world where so many romance novels are predicated on lies of omission or miscommunication. They both had more than their share of reasons to be distrustful of everyone else, so the stark candor they practiced with each other was the only way they were able to navigate their way to a relationship. The Naked Truth is one of the most unique second-chance romances I have ever read. Given the circumstances under which they first met and formed a relationship, they had an entire set of issues to overcome most couples don\u2019t. Even after they overcame their strange beginning life continued to lob all kinds of curve balls at them. I loved that neither of them laid down and just took the beating they were given, and they both fought for what they needed on a personal level with grace and understanding. The secondary characters in The Naked Truth were life. They added so much value to the story and gave us such a fascinating insight into the lives and hangups of both Layla and Gray, while still maintaining their places as standalone characters. Even the character I wanted to hate was so well-written I felt more compassion for them than I wanted to. I wish the loose ends were more fully wrapped up. There were two subplots that felt like they were just forgotten about by the story ended and I would have loved to have seen some closure for them, especially since one of them was the impetus for most of the plot. The Naked Truth is a complete standalone novel. The story is complete in a single novel. The book is written in dual first-person perspective, narrated by Layla and Grayson.", "review_title": "One of the most unique second-chance romances I've ever read.", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

That wasn\u2019t a success by any means \u2013 I rated it 2,5 stars, and while I had high hopes for a reverse harem set in a witching academy, my hopes fell flat and the book was a bit of a dissapointment. Still, I picked up book two, As You Witch, because I wanted to see if it would get any better. The series has a lot of potential, it just never executes it well, so I thought that maybe some of those kinks would\u2019ve gotten fixed in book two. Alas, no such luck, and I even liked this one less than the first one. This book was filled with unnecessary drama from the start until the end. With a million possible options to pick villains when your book is set in a witching world, the author keeps on using the mean girl as a villain. It\u2019s dull and predictable. The dialogue is so bad that I had to roll my eyes at every other sentence. Max is immature, childish, entitled, and the guys she\u2019s supposedly in love with are so bland and boring even I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep them apart. There is no conflict. There\u2019s nothing really at stake. The relationships are too perfect \u2013 these four guys are instantly OK with all of them being with the heroine, and none of them is trying to win her for themselves. Of the four guys, only two have a hint of a personality, and the other two are basically just thrown in so this would be a reverse harem and not a love triangle. Either give them more personality or focus on the two that do have developed personalities and that a reader can root for. Look, I know I\u2019m one of the few who isn\u2019t fond of this series, and it has really high overall ratings on Goodreads and Amazon. So, don\u2019t take my word for it, this is after all just my opinion.

I am also getting tired of the single H's who have so many flings and one night stands that they are too numerous to count yet the h's have one or two lovers, haven't had sex for years or they are still virgins. To manage those statistics they have to be discriminating and have standards. A heroine like this wouldn't want to be with a man who has had his dipstick dipped into so many vehicles, it's near ready to retire for a new one. Just saying, it would be nice to read about a discriminating hero for a change. This is the first book I have read of Erika Wilde and will probably be the last for above stated reasons.", "review_title": "Warning Bad Language", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

I use the lure of these stories as a reward for exercising 6 days a week. When one is available, I am diligent about making sure I get my minimum amount of daily exercise. In other words, I really enjoy these stories. The heroes are physically strong but emotionally starved half-organic/half-machine cyborgs who have escaped the tyranny of slavery. The heroines are take-no-cr*p strong in their specialties (i.e. engineering, genetics, piloting) and have no real fear of these emotionless (so they're told) war machines. I found Vapor's and Mira's story the least exciting of the Cyborg Sizzle series that I have read yet and I'm up to 12. I did like Mira's character, her actions, and her motivation much more than Vapor's. As pointed out, the Human Alliance is turning out to be really bad guys and their wickedness continues growing. I wish these books were longer, with more emotional pull of falling in love. There is an overabundance of sex... which is ok... but I tend to skim that and get to what I consider the meaty part of the couple falling in emotional love.

Why do we as women become so trusting of people in revered positions? Fathers, priests, professors? Samantha is young and beautiful and the next in line of attractive Professor Peter Bridges conquests, but like all women, she thinks she\u2019s \u2018the one\u2019. His physical appeal, wealth, knowledge and sophistication blinds her to the real man behind the mask he wears. He is a serial abuser of women. Even his act of seduction from the moment she meets him is a well-practiced pattern of behaviour. When you have doubt, even if it 1%, don\u2019t ignore it. Why would he, the charming professor choose her? Why is he insistent (definitely OCD) or pouring them each red wine, each evening. Is she looking for a figure to replace her philandering father who left her mother for a woman his daughter\u2019s age? Is she taken in by his better version of herself? When she falls pregnant 2 months into their relationship, her senses become more awakened and after the birth of their daughter Emily, a maturity develops in her character. She becomes aware of his various manipulations, lies, and cruelty of other women, and, over time befriends them. The leopard doesn\u2019t change his spots. Once a liar always a liar. Revenge is sweet. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

What I'm saying is, the negative I am about to expound on is not due to an untalented author. First, as I stated before, try as I might, I can't seem to get 'there' with this type of novel, this subject matter. Perhaps it's because of the saturation of terrorism headlines and fear in today's day to day life. I guess I don't want it in my fiction, where I go for entertainment, relaxation, comfort, etc...

It's like reading a mystery, and the author says \"the killer has been found!\", then not saying the killer's name.

That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\u2019t anything I didn\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

So far as the storyline was concerned, it was really good, as were those of the other two siblings, but I didn't think the episode of explicit sex when David and Vivi finally come together was necessary. And I thought it disturbed the tapestry of emotional and social upheaval that Beck had created. She did this in the other two sequels as well. I would caution those contemplating the book to go with the understanding that, if explicit sex bothers you, dont buy these!", "review_title": "Very Good storyline", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

I'm glad I read it, you can see where his ideas have contributed to Western Civilization and how his ideas were ripped off by everyone from Biblical writers to the US founding fathers. The style takes a bit to get used to, it's all in the form of a long-winded account of an overly polite conversation instead of a concise manifesto. While it's kind of annoying to have to shovel through that much prose, it's hard to image how else he could convey the nuances of his ideas without all the literary devices and chatter, some of which is still pretty funny.

So i feel my opinion is my bias & I surely feel bad to be negative. I don't want to lie either. With this being said, I started out liking the story & was thinking this is going to be good. Shortly thereafter one of the main characters became way too much for me to believe was a real person. I just wanted to \"slap\" this person's head. Please forgive me & my thought of abuse. I was overwhelmed by the infantile & idiotic acts & verbal trash from this person. It didn't help there were two enablers that had problems too, one person more than the other. Of course this is what the entire story is about. There were other side stories too so there are more characters that helped smooth out what was going on. In my opinion the only person being normal was a young person and much was said of the person's young-ness almost anytime mentioned. I was totally surprised by Grandpa popping up. What did I miss???? I have purposely tried to hide the sex of any of the characters except Grandpa as this review is my opinion of these people in a fictional story so you can make up your own mind.
