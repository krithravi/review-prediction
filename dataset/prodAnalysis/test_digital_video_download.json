I re-read the book and (bluntly) a lot of it doesn't hold up so well today, so the filmmakers took a lot of risks: some paid off and some didn't.

Some very interesting visual decisions were set up well but then filmed shockingly badly so they couldn't really be seen. But Storm Reid actively carries this movie with a performance so natural that I can't confirm she was acting; +2 stars just for the strength of her lead.

I wish it wasn't so preachy and shaming. There are two huge points glossed over in this. The first is that he got fat because of his psychological disposition rooted in the death of his younger brother then shame later at being \"fat\" in a fat shaming greater society. The second is that the film emphasizes exercise in weight loss despite having clearly shown that his excessive eating habits were the primary physiological contributor to his weight. People don't need to actually do workouts just to lose weight. Managing diet is enough. Exercise is great for conditioning but not as the primary tool of weight loss. It makes people think that intense workouts are the only way to lose weight and they're not. It's a false barrier. So... the shaming, blaming, preachy tone negates the useful info and overarching message. He even acknowledged the psychological contributor to his being overweight earlier only to self-blame further into the film... So too does the emphasis on exercise over diet weaken the effectiveness of the message. I'll add that taking a more patient, gradual approach would have been wise as well. He'll be more likely to gain it back with drastic changes in diet and exercise leading to drastic changes in weight in a short time.

I got bored mid way thru and skipped to about 20 minutes from the end. The pacing is slow and light on action, but does make up for it in character development as well as some stunning scenery. The family mansion is to die for. The plot is filled with clich\u00e9s about the nerdy high school girl who is bullied and yearns to be popular but is just to damn quirky to fit in including the stupid side kick who is loyal but likewise an outcast. However the thing that bothered me most was the not so subtle occult theme throughout the movie. In the end the girl ends up having essentially the power of a God and she is tasked with saving the planet from the evil scourge of humanity...oh and she's gonna birth the savior as well. I was confused as to whether she was gonna save the planet with her powers or usher in the savior as the prophecy foretold. Whatever, the movie abruptly ends with her declaring she wants to help after resurrecting and healing several friends who had just had an accident. I felt the acting was on par with the budget which wasn't much I'm guessing. Some decent actors who's careers are over and they just don't know it yet lol...There's a whole sequence in there about how evil humans are destroying the planet and global warming and such which was a turn off to me as well. And the mom kinda turns into a brutal dictator mid way thru which makes you want to hate her...but she had reasons I guess.

You get to see some of the survival techniques that people use like building a shelter, making fire, gathering food, etc. I found this interesting. This also adds a creepy element to the story where you feel like the guy really is helpless and all alone. The acting was decent. The character was pretty likable. The problem is the plot was extremely shallow and there wasn't enough meat to the story. I can only take so many scenes of aimless wandering through a sort of creepy forest. I had to start fast forwarding, and I am usually a patient person. Then the ending. This movie was so cliche... It would have been nice if it had ended in a slightly more creative way. One last positive: I give the movie props for its props. They looked kind of difficult to make and were convincing. (Talking about the little wood sculptures and skeletons setups.) Also the insects - Those were some really good convincing special effects. Everything here pointed to some real talent and the capability for creating a decent movie.

This could have been a great movie, but it was too unrealistic.

She is the one in the movie who has had the greatest amount of teachings on morality and yet she ends as the biggest most selfish sinner in the group. All life is scared and a gift from GOD.
