Although the bottle indicates it should be added to juices, milk or milk substitutes (like almond or rice milk) because it is somewhat bitter, I tasted the powders itself and didn't find that it had much flavor of its own and certainly nothing unpleasant. This is good, and exactly what I want, because it means I can mix it with anything and have no flavors or sweeteners in the product that I don't like or that taste bad with whatever liquid I'm mixing it in. Most other essential amino acid powders I've looked at - including the one I get from my nutritionist - have some combination of flavors like citrus and berry, some of which I totally dislike the flavors of. And as soon as they try to use fruit flavors, that requires the product to have sweeteners. In an attempt to use something natural, they all tend to use Stevia which has the most awful taste. To my taste buds, Stevia is way worse tasting than any of the artificial sweeteners. So I'm glad this product doesn't have any of that. The only reason I didn't give this product five-stars is because the powder doesn't want to mix will with water or other liquids. No matter how well I stir it, the powder lumps up and doesn't dissolve.

At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone.

I ended up loving this one so much I now use it as my main sling!!! It is SO soft inside -- unlike the scratchy one the hospital gave me that had seams and stitching inside w/ a rough fabric that ended up chafing and peeling the skin on my arm! This sling is so comfortable. Although the shoulder pad could be a bit more narrow, as that sometimes digs into my neck. I ended up replacing that with the pad from another sling and now it's perfect. The straps are very easy to adjust, and I even cut some of the velcro pieces and rounded the pointy ends so they'd be shorter and less \"noisy\". My arm is 12\" and this sling was a bit too long, but I was able to fold the wrist end back about an inch or two and hold it there with the two velcro pieces at the end. After the first week my surgeon took my pillow off and said I no longer needed it, so I am not using that part of it. Once you get this whole thing adjusted just right for you, you will love it! The only thing I wish was designed differently would be the strap at the wrist where it buckles. The velcro pieces are sewn on. If they were removeable I would be able to fold the \"cuff\" back further since it was too long for my arm. So I take off a star just for that reason.

My wife said it was too thick for her and didn't help so I adopted hers. I am 6'4\" and weigh 250 pounds and put one pillow just above my knees. The strap is very handy as I typically switch from 'left side' to 'right side' throughout the night. It isn't necessarily the separation that helps me as much as keeping my 'upper' leg from falling forward and twisting my lower back out of alignment. This, the pillow does a good job of. I did try to use my wife's pillow as a second pillow between my legs but it was just too much. Then I noticed the shape of the pillow might accommodate my head. I wear a full face CPAP mask which would get pushed loose on my traditional pillow. I tried the knee pillow as a head pillow, placing my face on the thick edge and allowed the face mask to project from the pillow free from pressure of any kind. It worked! Since I roll over from side to side through the night, the mask just projects from the other side as I settle in. Just remember to get your face up on the thick part so the mask doesn't touch the pillow. The knee pillow will stay securely between your legs and it becomes second nature to keep your legs together as you turn from side to side. This is not a 'cure all' but it will help keep your lower back from going out. I also use an inversion table and do lower back exercises every day. All in all, I would say this pillow is good as part of an overall treatment regime to relieve back pain. Oh, and it doesn't stink. I would buy this again, if for no other reason than it has a strap that helps keep it from getting lost in the bed.

After the patch test, I used the product following the instruction. After 40-50 min, I rinse very carefully. In my case, this product covers about 50-60% of grays, and some of them look like very dark gray, not black. Fine for me, and it covers grays better than I expected actually. I feel that my hairs get dry a bit, but not seriously. The color seems to be pretty dark, almost black, but fine for me. I observe more grays (in almost white or very light gray color) after 3rd shampoo, so need to use my usual touch-up product a little to cover grays. After 5th shampoo, I can see more grays. The color remains longer than 5 days, but gradually disappears from 3rd shampoo. In my case it takes about 1.5-2 hours from the preparation and clean up, so I do not want to repeat this every week. I use this product twice (1 bottle) and I guess I the amount is enough for me to use it 3 and half times coloring. Here's my opinion. I may use this product if I need to cover my grays longer than 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks between salon appointments. I think it would be better for me to use my touch-up product for shorter than 2 weeks period and use usual color product for longer than 4-5 weeks period.

I\u2019ve used it on both myself and my children and we\u2019ve had varying results when compared to each other, and compared to different times we\u2019ve used it. I am half black so my hair is pretty dry and kinky. I found that, post shower, it went in smoothly, spread out evenly, and combed through thoroughly. Sometimes, as my hair would dry, the product would harden (similar to gel), giving my hair a rough tecture, but not causing knots to form. My children are all a quarter black and so their hair is a bit different but still has the same degree of dryness that most African Americans experience. The first few times I used this product on my 4 year old, it was amazing. Whether it was post shower, or in conjunction with a water spritz to dampen her hair, it left her curls bouncing and soft to the touch. Then, I\u2019ve had other experiences where this product had turned into a gel-like substance upon drying, creating clumps, and matting her hair up more than it had been before. These experiences have been extremely distressing for her and doing her hair becomes a tear-filled nightmare. I\u2019ve tried to vary the amounts I\u2019ve used to see if that makes a difference but I\u2019ve had varying experiences regardless. Overall, this product is very hit and miss for me and I\u2019m a bit disappointed at the effect that it has at times. When it works, it\u2019s amazing and our hair looks and feels wonderful. When it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s awful trying to get the tangles out and sometimes even requires a rewash to get out.", "review_title": "At times, leaves hair feeling soft, accentuates curls; but can also cause hair to tangle and feel crusty.", "language": "en", "product_category": "drugstore"}

I just pour 2- drops in the cap then dip a very small paintbrush (the brush hair part is only about the size of a long grain of rice. I only use this brush for my nails) and apply it to my nails. The first week or so it stings the skin mild to medium when it gets on the skin. If you wipe the skin with water this really helps take away the sting on the skin. Another thing that helps is put lotion around the nail before you apply the oil. The lotion reduces/removes the sting. Either way the stinging goes away after a week. It is not that bad and it lasts about half an hour if you don't wipe the skin. I have only tried it for a short time with oregano oil and peppermint oil (which has menthol) and it does look like it is healing the nails some. I think I will also get some Rosemary oil for some camphor and other antimicrobial properties. I also like these oils because I regularly eat these herbs so I feel that they are safe for me.

They are a bit of a stretch on my feet, but it's within reason. If you have a larger foot, I would recommend avoiding. The way these cushions wrap around the feet helps keep them on the foot to a reasonable point, but over time, the cushion slides forward and has to be pulled back. The cushion itself seems to be made from a memory foam. After some use, the cushion is flattened. But after some time of non-use, the foam thickness recovers itself. The main drawback is that the cushion foam isn't thick enough to provide maximum comfort. Even adding just a millimeter of cushion would likely help a lot. Also, again, the fact that the cushion slides forward when in use is a minor drawback. I would recommend these cushions if you have tried other solutions and they haven't worked at all.

The first one I bought last year was the right way, but these were upside down. Mind you, I know that is because the old standard in the US was ground on bottom and the new standard is ground on top. I deducted one star because they should be able to update this design to accomodate a 180 degree rotation (or offer two versions), instead of me having to disassemble and rotate the plug myself.

I was so bummed. Obviously there was nothing I could do that morning to replace it. So here is my suggestion... Helium usually stays several days well so if you are going to get these and have Prime, get them blown up a few days in advance to ensure you have all four. If one or two are defective, let Amazon know but place your new order right away to get replacements with Prime in time. Or... If it's free returns, buy 2 sets and have one back up and just return the other set if you don't use. OR... you have just have money to blow, buy several sets. I wish I would have had a back-up plan.

It is sharp and has a ring of cologne. Granted, I have a pretty sensitive nose, but this stuff... whew. Were it not for the amazing way my hair feels, I'd not use it again. Even as it stands, as part of any nightly ritual, I think I'm going to leave it out and stick to the curl enhancing smoothie. I wash my hair twice a week, once with a clarifying shampoo, the other with something far gentler (also by Shea Moisture). I'm likely going to have it just be after my clarifying wash since it tends to leave my hair a bit dry. Other than that... the stuff is like gold as far as moisture and styling.
