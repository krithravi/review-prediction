The sounds quality is good. I do not consider myself an audiophile but I can tell lousy from decent when it comes to headphones and these fit squarely in the decent category, Cons: There is a severe delay when using Bluetooth (1-2 seconds) so much so that I gave up on using the bluetooth. I just plug them in using the USB-C to 1/8\" cable. It makes watching movies using Bluetooth a no-go with these headphones. I also notice the delay when pausing music. There is a 1-2 second lag from when I hit the pause button to when music actually stops. Noise cancelling doesn't do much more than add white noise to the audio. Build quality is mediocre. I have owned these 8 months and the power button broke (it is stuck depressed so I can no longer turn the headphones on). I wasn't expecting these to be awesome, but losing the Bluetooth functionality completely after 8 months seems pretty bad. The padding is also coming loose as shown in the photo.

I love that when I pull them out of the case, they automatically switch on and pair with my phone without having to push any buttons.

At first listen they were 'just ok', kind of hard and muffled sounding, but they broke in after a day of playing at a moderately loud volume and opened up a bit.. which is typical .. but it was still a little unexpected for me. So, give 'em a good crank and let them play for a day or 2 before you evaluate them critically. I don't understand why you'd use a spring-clip speaker input for these. Simple spades would be better.

Firstly, I bought these batteries for my Xbox One controller. They work well for this one, though I cannot use them in every other device on account of their large size, which seems to be rather normal for rechargeable batteries, though it is a good reason to dislike these a bit. After a while, I begun to realize that these batteries, for whatever reason, did not output as much power. Using them in the controller, or lights, or whatever evidenced that they were weaker than standard aa batteries. After a complete charge, they are on par, but it only takes 24 hrs, and they are weaker again. It appears that these batteries self-discharge incredibly quickly. This is disappointing because the batteries say \"low self-discharge\" on the package, and this is certainly not true. Using a device for measuring battery power, I can definitely say that a very sizable chunk of the power from a charge will have dissipated on the next day without even using the batteries. This all wouldn't be so bad, except that it makes it seem also like the batteries are more useful than they are. Originally, I thought very soon that I had already reimbursed myself for these batteries very quickly, but noticing that much of they power they deliver is subpar, and that much of the power is wasted simply through self-discharge, I can say that I probably haven't begun saving money yet by using these batteries. So, in conclusion, it's nice to get a charger and to have rechargeable batteries, but these batteries are sub-par when compared to alkaline lithium batteries, and they don't last as long. It will take quite some time before these will become profitable for the buyer. However, they are probably more eco friendly than buying AA batteries. Nevertheless, these are NOT low self-drain batteries.There may therefore be better options, especially because it takes forever for this charger to charge the self-discharging batteries.", "review_title": "Not bad, but not good either.

I have a huge collection of controllers of varying levels of cost and quality. The SN30 Pro is hands-down one of the most well-built controllers I have ever had the pleasure of using. Buttons are responsive, shoulder and trigger placement is natural, and turning it on and off for use with bluetooth connectivity is a breeze. The only gripe (and it is a minor one) is that for gamers with large hands you may find occasionally that your right thumb brushes against the left analog stick when playing SNES or other games that make heavy use of the B and Y buttons. It's an extremely minor annoyance and only worth mentioning because I feel like if you're going to spend 40+ bucks on a controller for your PC retro-gaming you should know this up front.

The build is excellent, made out of very strong plastic. The speaker has good insulation from dust and water, providing some needed features that other high end speakers don\u2019t have. Build: In my testing the speaker held out really well. I took it to camp to test out the durability. This speaker held out really well. The front amps get very loud when paired by Bluetooth. In my case I used an iPhone XS. In my case i used the speaker while I was outside By the campfire. Battery: I tested the battery nonstop and noticed that I got easily 6-8 hours on constant use. In my defense my phone didn\u2019t last as long thus battery life is very subjective to the loudness and if Bluetooth is use. I mostly connected the device via Bluetooth. Features: The main features that this speaker has are the micro sd card slot, and microphone built in. I used the speaker for offline use by transmitting music via bluetooth. Because I was camping the service in my area was fairly poor, thus just adding my whole music library to the micro sd or usb is very convenient.", "review_title": "Excellent sounding Speaker", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

Taking this little guy out of the box it felt very well built and sturdy considering how small it was. I LOVE the feel of turning the nobs, it gives you a very satisfying click click click as you adjust them. The sound quality out of this didn't significantly change the sound but it's possible I needed to let this thing burn in a little. The treble and bass adjustments worked well and provided a noticeable difference in sound from min to max. Sitting next to my class D amplifier with the cool blue lights on and the gold finish on the nobs looked very cool. Unfortunately when I plugged these in line between my source and my amp and powered it on it gave the speakers a large pulse which made sort of a BOOM sound. When I turned the preamp on and off I kept getting the boom sound which made me feel like it could be sending too large of a signal into my speakers, potentially damaging them. Since I spent good money for high quality speakers I didn't want to run the risk of damaging them with a cheap little pre-amp so I will not be using it anymore.", "review_title": "Cool pre-amp but could damage speakers", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

I previously had an older set of Sony headphones that I got back probably around 2013. They lasted me 6 years and I loved every second of using them. So, when they eventually broke back in July of this year I was tempted to buy a cheap pair of headphones but ended up deciding to spend the extra money and go with Sony again because of how much I loved the old ones which were now unavailable. These seemed to be the newer version of the old one I had so naturally I was expecting everything the old pair had and maybe even a better feel or sound quality. What I got was extremely disappointing. The Sound: actually a little bit worse than the old ones I had, simply just okay. The Quality/Feel: seemed like they were made extremely cheap and the uncomfortable feel of them showed that. I could maybe only wear these for about 30 minutes before it started hurting my ear and making me extremely uncomfortable. Not only that but now 2 and a half months after buying it the ear pad ripped completely off and (maybe I'm not too experienced with this and there is one) but I cannot figure out a way to put it back in. Overall, I would definitely not recommend these headphones for the price point that they're at. Even if I was given a $100 discount on these I still wouldn't even buy them again. Completely mediocre sound, terribly uncomfortable, and way overpriced.

I haven't used the case for the top of the system because I'm not sure what I want to do with this purchase. Since it's only $13 I'm not even sure if returning it would be worth it after paying to ship it back for the return, but it looks like it would be a decent case to protect the top of the system if you have nothing else. As far as the stylus goes, I actually used a mechanical pencil to pry the stylus out because I read the other reviews regarding the stylus being hard to get out. After you get the stylus out the first time it comes out without an issue (it might be connected by plastic before you break the seal inside? I'm not sure, but now it is very easy to get out, but still locks into place so it won't randomly fall out of the bottom). The stylus is exactly the same size and length of the stylus in the 2ds xl (I tried putting the stylus from the grip into the system and it fit perfectly). The stand on this works fine and feels sturdy. I don't think it would break easily. The overall feel of the grip is okay. It honestly feels like it's a bit lacking, I would probably go for the older version if I buy another grip because I noticed that one is larger..

This Polk bar offered similar features to the Vizio one we bought, but also includes a built-in Alexa. 300$ was a bit much for a soundbar but the Alexa made us think it would be worth the price. We were wrong. The first thing we noticed was the bar was noticeably thicker and longer than our Vizio, and we had to move our TV around to fit it on the stand. Also the subwoofer was awkwardly cone-shaped and felt like cheap plastic. The box contains generously both an HDMI cord and an optical audio cord, which is nice. We connected the bar and followed the instructions for the initial setup. Turns out you need to download a mobile app to setup the Polk, separate to the standard Alexa app we already used. After downloading the app, we of course now need to create a Polk account to sign in. I reluctantly performed all this hoping it was just for a first time setup, but unfortunately I could not find a way to use the Polk Alexa from the Alexa app. The Polk app itself is fairly barren compared to the Alexa app. We completed the setup, and the TV finds the soundbar pretty quickly through the CEC, which is great. But then we notice just how LOUD Alexa is, much louder than the show we were testing the volume with. The Alexa voice does NOT have a separate volume control anywhere, and will always be louder than the TV output. So if we are sitting at the ideal volume for our show, and then ask Alexa to turn off the lights, she will SHOUT back at us. This is a feature that the Polk app desperately needed. One of the features we tested with the Polk Alexa was to have it play Spotify, which it did like we wanted. But when we told it to stop, it would not automatically resume playing TV sound. After fumbling with voice commands for 5-10 minutes, we had to use the remote to force it back to TV HDMI input. We dug through the rather small manual trying to find the appropriate voice command, only to eventually find it on the Polk app of all places, hidden under some menus. The phrase was something like \"Alexa, set input to TV\" and if you said anything less than exactly that phrase, Alexa would refuse. Normally Alexa allows for some flexibility in the way you issue commands, so this was frustrating to remember exactly how to phrase it. Regarding the sound quality itself, we were extremely disappointed. So disappointed that we decided to stay with our dying Vizio for a while longer than suffer using the Polk. Our bedroom is probably considered medium-sized, comfortable but not huge. At first I said to my wife \"The sound doesn't seem much different than the TV speakers\", which I soon discovered was because the TV speakers were overpowering the sound bar. I turned off the TV speakers so I could judge the bar by itself, and was shocked at how poor the quality was. I could not clearly hear sound from the Polk soundbar from greater than 7 or 8 feet away, and increasing the volume certainly made it louder but not clearer. After spending the better half of my day trying to convince myself to accept the Polk, we decided to cut our losses and go back to the Vizio.", "review_title": "Refunded it", "language": "en", "product_category": "electronics"}

It had a good, solid feel to it, kind of like the Bose Soundwear, and sound is fairly good, the Bluetooth transfer rate kinda sucks sometimes, so whatever you are listening to might get choppy for no real reason. What killed it for me was how incredibly rigid this thing is and how tight it was on my neck. I wore the LG all day today. I usually wear the Bose all day. I could not wear this for more than a few minutes; it was tight on my neck. It doesn\u2019t flex...at all. Is probably great if you have a thin neck, but not so much for adult males. Price is fair from what I can tell. I couldn\u2019t say anything about the battery life. Won\u2019t really know much about the choppy sound issues and if they ever clear up.

The trouble is, thicker jackets do not equate to higher quality. Thinner jackets work just as well and are much less aggravating to work with. The thick jacket and heavy duty plug prevent this cable from fitting into the pocket in the back of my Vizio M Series TV or next to any other HDMI cable in an adjacent socket on my Sony ES receiver. Here is the naked truth about HDMI cables: they either work or they don't, and there is no such thing as a premium passive cable. There are only 3 possible outcomes with any given HDMI cable: 1. Does not work 2. Works with artifacts (random white dots) 3. Works If your outcome is 1 or 2, your equipment does not like the cable, or you need an active cable for a long run. If your outcome is 3, you are good to go. There is no higher quality level than \"works,\" considering the error-corrected digital nature of how HDMI signals are transmitted. That is a long-winded explanation of why this cable is unnecessarily thick. Thicker absolutely does not mean more \"premium\" -- just more difficult to use. Or, in my case, impossible to use. The last 2 Amazon Basics HDMI cables I purchased were a normal thickness with a normal sized connector, and they worked great. C'mon, Amazon!

The retract mechanisms (yo yo's). They feel pretty cheaply made but do function. I was intending to use just 1 or 2 to hold my cord up but found that they are very weak and I have to use 3 of them for my setup. I will keep the other 3 as spares in case these break. The cable its self is a very thin steel cable with a plastic coating on it. They are secured with little collets which have a grub screw that you can loosen up with an included tool ( one tool per yo yo) to make the loop smaller or shorten the pull out length which would likely increase the pull strength. These grub screws seem to really pinch the cable and I am worried about it fatiguing the cables causing a failure. Time will tell The sticky pad hooks... Total garbage, have another plan on how to secure the yo yo's to the wall or a fishing pole above you. These will looks god awful on your wall and they are really not the right design to hold the yo yo's and you will likely have problems with the yo yo's coming off the hooks if you actually use them The included carabiners are very low quality as well but get the job done. In conclusion I think the kit is a bit overpriced for what it is, but it is a good start at good cable management.

Funny thing, if you press them close to your head, you get more treble, but if you have a bit of a gap, you hear more bass. The volume does not stand up to a windy bike ride. They are molded in such a way as to not be adjustable, so that they may not sit in the position for optimal conduction unless you rig it just so. That really needs to be addressed.
