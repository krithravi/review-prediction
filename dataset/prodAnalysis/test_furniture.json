Standard box, everything inside is neatly packed and the clean up is amazingly easy, aside from the big ole box that is left, but what else would we expect right? :) Assembly, I followed the instructions and they were pretty straightforward. Bolts come with Loctite(blue agent on the threads that helps the bolt resist being backed out naturally) so the bolts do not need to be super tighted, only hand tightened plus your tightening them through a pretty tough plastic, I was able to hand tighten everything without anything cracking, so the quality of materials used seems decent. Really no issue with assembly if you follow instructions. As for use, I feel this is wear it is slightly lacking. On the positive side the cushions are extremely comfortable, from the arm rests to back, to base. Everything is pretty comfortable and don't feel stiff or rough. I love leaning back in my old computer chair and kicking my feet up on anything I can get a grip on and this chair is definitely great for leaning back and relaxing. What it is lacking in is more so sizing. For instance my personal preference is I wish the arms were extended a little bit further out as it feels like I need to tuck my arms against my side to get any use out of them, not a complete deal breaker though as the arms are comfortable, just not as long as I want. Also the back piece could be a bit taller as it goes to my shoulders, unless I recline, then I can rest my head on the top of the back rest, also not an deal breaker as I am an avid gamer and play most games in a forward focused pose.

It assembles very quickly with clear instructions. I was able to put 2 units together in about 3 hours without another person. I found the pieces to have a very strong smell after opening the box, reminiscent of a carton of cigarettes. The smell has faded but is still not 100% gone. Recommend you air it out if you choose to purchase this product. For the price, you get a good amount of storage. I use this is in a guest room to display photos and house some storage boxes. They are not extremely sturdy however, so be careful storing heavy or breakable items. The kit provides you with a standard metal hex key. The problem is that you're pushing screws into pre-drilled holes and securing it on the back with a nut. The hex key was pretty useless without something to secure the nut. You'll absolutely need an adjustable wrench to be able to tighten it properly. I found that even when properly tightened, the piece doesn't feel 100% sturdy. There's a lot of wobbling around if you apply even a little bit of pressure to the unit since the bamboo is so lightweight. May not be a great idea around kids since this could easily fall over if a kid where to try to climb or pull themselves up with it. This does look a little cheap. The slats for the shelves are glued, and you can easily see the excess glue that wasn't wiped away. I had a few areas with splintered wood, especially around the pre-drilled holes. In some cases, there would be a small finishing nail partially blocking the pre-drilled hole to secure the shelves. One or two spots where the pre-drilled hole doesn't exactly line up properly, preventing you from getting a 100% secure with that shelf. Overall, for the price, I find it's worth it. It's a pretty yellow-toned bamboo but accurate to the product pictures. I think this would look cool painted white. I'd recommend keeping this in a place out of the reach of kids. Would be good in a pantry, basement storage, or garage for small items or lightweight things. Edit: Also want to mention that one of the shelves is branded with the Costway logo. Since my unit is against a wall, I just assembled to make sure that the logo would be against the wall, but keep that in mind if you want this to be used as a room divider and visible from both sides.", "review_title": "Good for the price but you need a wrench", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

The Box weighs about 90 lb so if your frail or small make certain to have someone to help you move the box where it needs to be. The bed was easy to assemble and came with all parts needed, including hardware. The only downside was my fault as I was using the incorrect screws because two sets of screws have same height and looked similar in the manual. Please note that the screws are different widths. Don't waste time like I did LOL use the manual and follow it to a T. Even with my mess up it still came out great. You would definitely need two people to help hold pieces in place while you screw in and use the allen key to secure. Some pieces will require you to keep the screws loose so don't fully tighten until you're certain you're done with that part. Other than that the bed is super sturdy and it will take you a couple of hours to assemble with help, maybe 3 without help. Also if you are trying to fit a desk under here you won't be able to as it's very low. I'm 5'4 and had to stoop half my height to get under the bed. Anywho buy this you won't regret it.

It's roomy, comfortable and feels sturdy. I like that it's made for HON, which is a big office furniture company and I've used their products before. The chair arrived in a single carton, approximately 57 pounds. No damage to the packaging like other reviewers have noted. Everything was intact, undamaged and didn't show signs of prior use. Assembly took about 15-20 minutes using the provided hardware, hex key and instructions. Might have gone faster if I used a ratchet or power tool for the bolts, but not much to it: - insert casters in the star base, followed by the gas lift cylinder - attach mounting base to the seat (4 bolts), followed by the seat back (4 bolts) - attach the arms (4 bolts each, 8 total) - check bolts again for tightness - place seat on gas lift cylinder - sit & adjust as needed As another review noted, the assembly instructions has a couple steps out of order. You should attach the mounting base (J bolts) before the seat back (K bolts) since part of the mounting base goes under the end of the seat back bracket. If you follow the instructions as currently written, you'll have to undo the K bolts and remove 2 of them to attach the mounting base, then redo the K bolts. It's not a big deal, just hope the advice saves someone else the time. The chair itself is roomy with a thick seat cushion. The seat feels nice so far, hopefully the foam holds up over time. The seat back gives decent support, though I try to not lean back too much. The lumber support piece is adjustable, which is nice, though not sure how much I feel it doing. The recline is also nice, goes back a bit - you aren't going to take a nap in it. The arms adjust for height and have cushioning, can also adjust their width a bit with the mounting bolts. Overall I'm pleased with the chair so far. Will update if it changes over time. In the meantime, I feel confident putting the old chair out in the rubbish.", "review_title": "Big chair, sturdy & comfortable so far.", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

Stool is small and will creak when you sit on it, but feels sturdy once you do. The stool could have been wider and still fit under the counter. The stool's top is pretty and a nice contrast to the dark color of everything else. Mirror was a pain to install because it wouldn't stay put, and isn't the right height for me to do my hair, so I don't really use it. Adding lighting to it was too annoying. The top drawers are attached to the mirror via arms in the back and a wooden piece below, which isn't attached to the counter at all so is a slide hazard - there should be a way to latch the piece to the counter for safety. I would have preferred the mirror and top drawers to not be one piece, since I need the drawers more than I need the mirror, I have to disassemble the mirror + arms, which will be bulky to store. The top drawers are pretty small, I would have preferred them to be wider or even meet in the middle for more versatility. The bottom edge of the vanity where your legs will brush is unfinished and will snag whatever you're wearing. Mine was really dusty and I needed to assemble this with a mask on, you'll want to clean the bottom edge and maybe sand it a little to remove the snags. If the stool is too tall, you could use bedpost risers for the vanity itself or some other means of stable elevation. I've used this for a few weeks and realize that it's actually too small for me, but I needed it to fit the space available (width) more than I needed it to have more/wider drawers or depth.", "review_title": "but feels sturdy once you do", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

Came in an approximate 12 inch by 5 foot box. The predrilled holes didnt all align perfectly. Some did, but others didn't. Had to take it apart twice and get a second set of hands to push together to help align the holes a bit better. It took about 3 hours to install (including the redoing twice!) And the wood is more like particle board (as you begin drilling that becomes more noticeable). But now that it is done, i love it!! It gives off a more expensive feel. Great buy for the price. A few notes... 1) It suggests laying on a carpet as you install. That is smart. You can see by my picture that the metal and wood did scratch from the tile floor. *sigh. I should be able to touch it up. 2) Also, they recommend using the foam that packages the product when installing the E and K boards to fill the space between the boards and the floor to prevent bending and possible breakage. I will tell you this, it helped with the power drill, having those boards level. So that was also a good suggestion in the instructions. 3)The stickers that labeled the boards (almost all boards have a sticker) peel off effortlessly. I wouldve given it 5 stars had the install been a little smoother. I really recommend 2 people.... 1 screwing and 1 pushing boards as tightly as possible together to line up. 4) Also, flashlight is probably needed. We used one to make sure holes were lines up. I do recommend this if you are looking for an affordable, higher end looking headboard. It does the trick! (Once you get past the install!)", "review_title": "Good buy!

It looks pretty good considering that it's imitation woodgrain over particle board. We got two, and the included brackets made it easy to attach them together without drilling or screws. The box was falling apart on one set, but everything inside was OK. The other had a perfect box but had a few dings on the material. Go figure.

You do sink about 2 inches or so when you sit on the stool (i weigh 150 lbs) so they are not high quality air cylinders. on the bottom of the base, there is a \"plastic\" ring around to protect the floor.

I have long legs, wear shorts most of the time, and move a lot, so the need for having a flexible chair is a must to have. This chair you need patience, patience, and a good back before you decide to put it together. There are so many small parts and somewhat complicated instructions that lack details. The tools kit that comes with the chair is useless. The wrench slips a lot, so expect to bump your fingers around the chair inners(not a pleasant experience). Once you managed to put it together, adjusting the chair is another headache on its own! This is where I am debating on returning or keeping this chair. There are six knee positions you can adjust this chair, and that is great, but the problem with is that you need to remove a long bolt holding the chair against a wall to stop it from collapsing flat on the growing-risking snapping your fingers-. There's another adjuster that it's designed to adjust the height, you have to get off the chair eyeball it to what you might like, sit and if that does not work, get back off and readjust again. You can't adjust it while sitting unless you have a strong grip, and I lift. In all, this is my first week using the chair, and already feel the benefit of having a knee chair. It helps balance the weight on my lower back. It's very comfortable, feels great moving around my workstation. I will def use it and if I decide to keep it will have to remove bolts to it from scratching me. Notes to the manufactures: 1. adjusters should be improved or made to where anyone can adjust while sitting. 2. the screws and bolt design should be revised. 3. the sitting is too steep, it would be nice that it can also be adjustable.", "review_title": "The chair you want to love but hate", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

The distressed wood is heavy duty rustic style. Love it because there\u2019s no worrying about roughing it up. The more use it gets the more it looks distressed. The legs come in several different pieces that are fairly easy to assemble, although the holes for the screws were drilled a bit off. Giving four stars because the legs are a kinda cheap metal. Do like that there\u2019s ample foot rest though. For the price and the beautiful wood it\u2019s totally worth it. Would definitely recomend!

I decided to make the move and buy this mattress and it was the BEST thing I have bought in a long time! Oh my goodness it is so soft but holds weight, when I get out of bed I don't disturb my boyfriend and vice versa. Some reviews said it didn't expand all the way out to 13 inches mine did within the first 4 hours of opening it. The box it comes in is large and heavy. I would absolutely recommend opening it in the room you plan on using it in. Be careful not too cut the mattress when you open the packaging.
