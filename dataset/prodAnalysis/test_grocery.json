It actually has a little bit of a sweet taste, almost like honey and oats. I wouldn't say it taste nutty. Which was a little disappointing, but it taste good so... The downfall, for me, is how oily it feels in your mouth. Actually, the more I eat it the less I like the texture and consistency. When you first open it, it is runny and needs to be mixed. I read in the reviews to refrigerate it. I did both and it firmed up nicely. However, almost as soon as I scooped it out it pooled out and went right back to that runny paste consistency.

I had to trim it to fit on a 1/4 sheet cake because it was too big. I have tasted the previous cake toppers when I trimmed them and they tasted delicious so I popped a small piece that I trimmed in my mouth and noticed this one tasted very bland and not at all sweet. It was rather nasty. So I figured that it would taste better with the cake. Put it on and when it was time to cut the cake and dish it, not many wanted to finish their small piece. I had my small slice and sure enough it was still very bland and I apologized to my guests. I explained they could scrape their topper off and we did and the cake itself was yummy.

I don't know about #1 but strong Oolong can hold it's own against coffee to keep you awake, but it's more like a mallet than a 5lb hammer and for me it's not addicting like coffee is. And it's worth noting that with Oolong you can brew it again several times and get good tea unlike some other teas. Anyway, this tea stands out for me as being a higher quality than I have had before. The first time I made some I noticed it had a little more smooth taste. That is, despite being brewed moderately strong there was no hit of bitterness. Something I only noticed by it's absence with this tea. It's not cheap but I think it's very good.
