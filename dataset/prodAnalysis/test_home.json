This make the light vibrate, too, which will give you a headache as it looks like the light is dimming and brightening repeatedly! This is not the light's fault, but vibration is a concern if you are sticking this light to anything that can vibrate, like a sewing machine. If I set my machine to sew at a slower speed I do not have the vibration so the light works fine, illuminating the foot area beautifully! I even have a new machine with stadium lighting, but this adds that extra punch of light right at the foot where I need it, especially when using a 1/4\u201d foot with a built in black guard on it!

There is no explanation about installing the door stops, so if you just install the stops at the end of the bar, both doors will slide the full extent of the bar, instead of perhaps stopping one door part way so that the 2nd door can bypass it and close the opening. Making an adjustment after the fact requires significant disassembly. Finally, the number of washers provided is insufficient to prevent the end of the bolt on the inboard most rail from extending through the bracket so far that it impacts the slider for the inboard door.

Finding screens in our part of the world is difficult, so we had a friend bring them in his luggage on a trip. Installation is pretty easy. Make sure to have the center of the top slightly higher than the corners, as some of the instructions describe. It makes a big difference on how easily it closes. Function is very nice. Walking through is easy and they usually fall right back into place. The dogs figured it out quickly and learned to use them without challenges. So we were very happy with these for almost six months. That's when the first seam started coming undone, the one along the top, allowing the screen to start drooping out. We patched it a bit, but within a few weeks it had reached a point where it had to be taken down so some more serious repairs could be made. A couple weeks later, another one started coming apart. This time it was along the opening, resulting in the screen separating from the hem and magnets falling out. So we've now had to take that one down too. So out of four doors, two of these started falling apart at about 6 months. These two were in doors that are used regularly, so they received more traffic. The other two seem to be holding up, but are rarely used. Basically we open the doors for ventilation, seldom passing through them. So perhaps those will last longer. The way they came apart, we can probably repair them. If not, then one needs to balance the idea of replacing them every six months with the value they provide. We're not sure what we'll be doing at this stage. It's too difficult to send them back overseas, so returning probably isn't worth it. At this price level, replacing them might be an option. I'd gladly pay more for something that would last years rather than months though.", "review_title": "Great idea with little durability", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

I find the \"warm\" lighting offered with both types are still too cold for my taste. Some get it very close to warm/soft light, these are cold...nothing near warm...nothing beats the warm glow of incandescent lighting. Another thing I hate with led and florescent is the slight buzz or flicker my eye can detect. Did you know that led's can actually interfere with a garage door opener, reducing the range or the door not opening at all if the led light is close to the door opener antenna. Anyway, these are still a bit too cold and my eye can detect a slight buzz effect. They fit perfectly in my under counter puck light fixtures. The original xenon lights while casting a nice warm light got ridiculously hot! to the point I was afraid to leave them on too long! These led's are much better, very very well made...actually I'm very impressed with the quality. My set up isn't on a dimmer switch. After reading all the negative reviews about dimming issues. I will buy a led type dimmer switch and see how well they work. I have a feeling most negative reviews are due to incorrect dimmer switches and/or electrical disturbance from bad home wiring and poor grounding. led's are very sensitive to this. ***UPDATE*** I went out and bought a dimmer switch appropriate for Led lights and installed it. These work flawless, dimming all the way down without any flickering issues. I would think most people have the incorrect dimmer switch or poor electrical wiring not grounded correctly. even so, I may return these as they're a very cold, greenish white. Just not a pleasant tone even when turned down with the dimmer switch. Ultimately, these are not as described....says warm light....it's nothing near it. I have other fixtures with \"warm\" led lights and they are a lot closer to warm tones. If you don't mind a cold bright white with a slight greenish hue...these will work for you. Again, these are well made and work well with the appropriate dimmer.", "review_title": "I may return these as I feel the color is too harsh and cold toned...not warm as advertised", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

Pros: This product worked as advertised, and produces a nice thick stream of mist that does not leave a residue or white film. Runs about 9-10 hours on max with a full tank. Since it's a large volume of water, it requires a lot more oil to get the scent in the room. I started with 6-8 drops, but eventually was up to 14-16 or so. The motor is very quiet, and the auto-shut off worked as expected. Cons: The blue light on the dial is fairly bright and there's no way to turn it off. Turns red when it's out of water, but still just as bright. In order to fill the water tank, you have to lift it off the base and usually spills a bit of water. I'm sure with practice I'd get better, but a top-fill unit may be better. Lastly, although the vaporizer motor is almost silent, there is an audible gurgle and bubbly sound periodically as the water moves from the tank to the humidifier. It's a spring loaded cap, and was noticeable while trying to fall asleep. I'm going to return the unit, but only because of the light and the water tank.

To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3\" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say \"don't buy this\", but I would be forewarned.

But the actual rebuild process is NOT for the faint of heart. Taking apart my toilet and removing the old flush kit was really demanding and I don\u2019t recommend it - whoever installed my old one overtightened every locknut - but a lot of people overtighten stuff and you\u2019ll probably encounter the same. I had to melt and break the big plastic locknut below the tank, it simply could not be removed by hand (and nobody has a wrench that big!). Once all that is done, the rebuild with this kit is actually not too bad, and the directions are good. I had to get creative a couple times (nobody has a hacksaw!), but I got through it. The final part, reattaching the tank and whatnot, is actually also tricky because you want to get it even on both sides, water tight, and you probably have other stuff in your bathroom like a sink and a tub and walls and it\u2019s hard to get your head in there to see what you\u2019re doing. I think I did mine imperfectly, because for the first few weeks there would be a small leak (just a couple tablespoons of water) seeping from between the tank and the base. Not upon flushing, but gradually over 8-12 hours and then I\u2019d give it wipe. I thought I\u2019d have to remove and reattach the tank again, but then the leak just stopped? I guess things evened out with time, gravity and dumb luck. Seriously. A month now with no leaks. Like I said, my toilet works great now. By all accounts it shouldn\u2019t. I am *somewhat* handy (building ikea furniture is so much fun! I can change the wiper blades, tires, and tail lights on my car! I own basic tools!)- handier than a typical millennial - and very tenacious, and while I recommend this flush kit, I do not recommend that you install it by yourself unless you are handier than me. Before you say something sexist, I installed this flush kit while 13 weeks pregnant, so I was simultaneously growing a human when I did it, and trust me I still did it better than a lot of men could.

But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty.

I just purchased this and it already ripped after lifting the bag for the first time with my clothes in it. I read someone\u2019s review about the same problem before purchasing and had my fingers crossed hoping it wouldn\u2019t happen to me... but it did :/ On the bright side, however, I was able to fit an entire dresser full of clothes into this bag! I had to get rid of my dresser and make more space in my room ASAP and had to purchase something quickly. I only bought one at first because I wanted to make sure I liked the product and also to see how much I could actually fit before getting more. When I first received the bag, I did not like the quality. I wanted to return it but found out returns were not accepted for this item. So I had no choice but to give it a try, and to my surprise, was able to fit all the clothes from my large dresser. I definitely did not expect everything to fit! I thought I would have for sure needed at least two. Anyway, I was very happy with my purchase at that point and didn\u2019t have any problems either, so I ended up purchasing another one even though the price had increased. That, of course, was a mistake as the plastic from second bag tore the moment I lifted it with my clothes to set it aside. I haven\u2019t touched the first bag since I put my clothes in it but I\u2019m pretty sure if I touch it again, it will rip. The bag definitely saves you a ton of space but I would suggest looking elsewhere for a similar product that is better quality. It is definitely worth it to spend a little extra for a stronger quality bag that will last longer. This particular item, on the other hand, is cheaply made and is not worth the price, unless the cost is less than $5. Yes, I was able to fit everything in the bag but what good does that do for me if the bag is ripped up? Keep in my mind the bag is lightweight only because it\u2019s made from very cheap quality. I shouldn\u2019t have purchased the second one but oh well... like I said, it\u2019s okay for now until I find something better.", "review_title": "Avoid! Very Cheap Quality! Bag will Rip!

The mechanism doesn't have the option of being able to open the door from the inside while locked. On the outside, unlocking the door with the key is in the opposite direction of the handle's direction to open the door. The key unlocks by turning counter clockwise and then you have to turn the lever clockwise to open the door. These things might sound minor, but do it multiple times a day and it gets old.

It was in an answered question by the seller on one of the lux bidet product pages . I have a Bemis Solid wood seat which is \"easy clean\". See the pictures for how I installed it.. And to see how much of a gap it leaves. I tested it out before gluing and the bidet doesn't spray through the gap.. The spay goes... Where it needs to. I got these bumpers because the first Bemis toilet seat I got, broke (pictured). I am quite a heavy gentleman. The angle of the seat caused by the bidet caused it to bend and break. I plan on getting four more of these, I will use two of the new four pack to put between the upper and lower ones., The middle of the seat clearly needs some support too. As to how sticky these things are.. meh, I used a scraper to take off the double stick foam tape. I could tell that foam tape wasn't going to hold. I used two part epoxy instead. I advise placing the bumpers with masking tape first. Take it for a test run. I had to move the bumpers a couple times to get them just right and not wobble. The suggested placement may work well for a round seat, butt it won't answer for an oblong seat. The bumpers clearly need to go horizontal instead of vertical in the case of my bowl and seat. Not all are the same so... use scientific method. I can see how the gap may cause an issue for some, do to spray... it didn't for me, but four isn't enough to get the job done in my case six....

The last time I used it (before the holidays) it wasn't staying hot. I was trying to figure out if it was related to the position of the cord but I finished the project before resolving that question. The next time I went to use it the rod didn't heat up. It got a little warm near the tip so current was being passed, but I could hold it so not really hot at all and not usable after that. I tried for a half-hour and then later I even took it apart to make sure a wire wasn't disconnected or crossed. Everything was as it should be - just never got hot anymore. I used it less than a dozen times but didn't spend a lot and it came with lots of tips and other good stuff I can use with the new one I bought locally. The new one cost more money (double) but has a temperature control, which I learned was important for how I need to use the tool. This first burner was good enough to get me started.

In the instructions it tells you not to dis-assemble the factory connection. When I cleaned the gun I would run whatever solvent was recommended through the gun then take the nozzle pin and head apart and scrub those clean. Then wipe down the interior of the gun nozzle. The issue I had was the knob where you turn it from a line to a bead was getting paint backed up into that chamber. It got to the point where I was unable to turn it and it eventually snapped. I had to contact the company and get a replacement sent out and when I took it apart the interior was completely full of gunked up paint.

It's like 60 seconds from plug-in till it's ready to steam. I can get 2-3 men's polos done between fills.

You are better off buying lights without glue on the back and installing yourself. Flexible is also a misleading description for this item.

You cannot have it just cycle between blue and white or something like that. I don't think these are actually capable of doing any colors besides those pre-installed on the remote.

Durable towel ring. I guess it is strong and big enough for a large bath towel. 2. Rust free material. The towel ring is made from 304 stainless steel. Heavy metal not fake metal like others I saw. 3. They are nicely finished and attractive. 4. Come with all hardware for mounting, and 2 limited gifts. 5. Modern design, looks very sharp. 6. Installation was very easy and only took several minutes. 7. Very good price. You receive two towel rings with such a low price.

It's not as padded as my last rug. But not thin by any means. I do wish it really stayed in place when you put it down. Now don't get me wrong, it doesn't shoot out from under your feet like a rug with no backing at all. But it does move some with all the walking we do on it daily.

Does what it says it's supposed to do. I've managed to successfully set it up and connect/use it with Google Home app and control with my voice. Sometimes there's a bit of a delay when using Google to control it, but it's not terrible for my use-case. All features seem to work. It took me a little bit to set up because the instructions aren't very good. They call the app one thing in the instructions but the actual app is called something else. The QR code provided wouldn't work for me so I had to go digging around to figure out the correct thing to download. If you scroll through the Amazon item listing for it, it names the correct app to go find in the play store. The app itself works but isn't as user-friendly as it could be. The scheduling is in military time, I can't figure out how to delete schedules that are set up (can only edit or toggle on and off, but not delete), some more info on what each setting is for or how to use it could be useful, and updated/clearer instructions for setting up Google Home to use with it. Luckily I know how to add new devices in GH app, but for others this may be a larger issue. So as I said, decent for the price and does what it says. I think it could be a great little device if they improved the user-experience a bit more as far as instructions and app go so that things are consistent, clear, and using good English. I may buy more in the future but not sure.", "review_title": "Works With Google Home", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

I didn't need anything heavy-duty, from a weight bearing standpoint, but I did need the largest rolling racks I could find. This item appeared to be a good size, at a reasonable price. Packaging/Build Quality The shipping box arrived intact with no visible damage. All of the items were present when I opened the box. There wasn't really any packaging material to speak of, except for some plastic spacers that allow the shelves to be stacked without finish damage. The poles are each in two pieces, and there are a number of bags of shelf stops. The leveling feet are already mounted to the poles, while the casters are in a plastic bag that's ziptied to one of the shelves. Assembly is indeed tool-less, but it would be a good idea to have a boxcutter to detach the goodie bag, and possibly a rubber mallet to tamp the shelves down on the tapered, clamshell stops. While the finish quality is fine, 4 of the 6 shelves had noticeable damage which probably affects the load bearing capacity of the unit. Assembly/Appearance Assembly is a fast affair. I removed the leveling feet and screwed in the casters. From there put one set of stops on the bottom of each caster adorned rod. I didn't screw the poles together so I wouldn't have to deal with guiding shelves down 6 feet of poles. Once I positioned the first three shelves, I screwed in the top rods and finished placing the rest of the shelves. Unfortunately the degree of shelf damage kept the shelves from sitting completely level. I used a rubber mallet to get everything seated properly. Performance Once assembled, the unit is fairly square and holds everything that I wanted to put on it. Keep in mind that the damage probably affects the load-bearing capacity of the shelves, but I'm not putting anything heavy on it in the first place. Conclusion The low review is because of all of the mangled parts. It would be one thing if the damage came in the process of shipping, but some of the interior shelves in the stack showed the exact same damage (pictured). I'm not going through the hassle of packing everything back up and getting to a shipping location. I definitely DO NOT recommend this item, given my experiences (but YMMV).", "review_title": "Poor quality control on my item, YMMV. Not recommended", "language": "en", "product_category": "home"}

So I exchanged all 3 and received a new shipment that had 2 queens and 1 king. Because it was an exchange, they made me return all 3, even though 2 were queens. So I placed another order for 3 queens and got 2 queens and 1 king. Okay so I can now keep the 2 queens and exchange the king for a queen. Nope. The replacement they sent today was yet another king. Will this never end? I have a vacation rental and use these on all my beds, they were great until this inconvenience.

Several bandaids and gauze and peroxide and an application of neosporin later...i tried using the shaver again. I would say that it's effective but i had hoped it was going to be slightly more magical, i.e. really quick. You have to be somewhat slow and methodical--but it will definitely collect a lot of pills in the clear bin. The really stubborn pills on a fleece pullover took more effort than a pilled-up hat did. Ultimately I was happy to see my clothes look refreshed. It's much bigger than the battery operated ones I've seen at WalMart. The advantage of the larger size is the larger collection bin. I had a battery operated shaver that was small and easy to use, but I had to stop every minute and empty it. I downgraded the stars due to the noise which seemed to affect the cat more than my vacuum cleaner. The other reason is the feeling of the shaver being not as zippy to shave the fabric as I expected for it's large size.

It's not the best quality blanket, and the static can be somewhat problematic (I did run it in the dryer with a bunch of dryer sheets and it put a dent in it, but it's winter and the air is dry).

The not so good news is that the weave, although it looks great at first glance has a lot of roughness. Due to this roughness in the weave everything clings to it. It is virtually impossible to turn over at night without lifting the sheet up first. Maybe if you wear satin or slippery pajamas it would not do this. However with cotton knit pajamas the sheets cling to them. I think this material would be better suited for making curtains where roughness of the fabric is not an issue.

Got it and put it together no problem mounted charger on wall and put 2nd battery in to charge. Put vacuum in its place to charge and it wound not charge. After some investigation it seems that when you put it in to charge it pushes a button on back that brings up the charging connector. It does not seem to bring it up high enough to make a connection. If I put anything between the vacuum and the button it seems to work but I really dont think I should have to \"fix\" a $300 vacuum. I contacted the company and after many email and pictures they sent me a new base. Same issue. Gave up and out a small piece of card board behind the vacuum and it works. As far as performance it really does a good job sucking up all the chalk dusty on these pool tables. It does clog up the filter in and hour of use but it comes out and we have been washing them out. It also came with 2x filters so that is nice. Batteries on high only last 20 min or so.

I have the ac turned on ac mode and the fan turned up. The hose is installed right, not bent or obstructed. I set the temp down to 70. I cleaned the filters and emptied the water. But ac still only comes on for at most 2 min then there is a thump noise and it turns off leaving only the fan going. Then after about 5 min the ac comes on then turns off again. It's been doing this for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I'm miserable and hot and drenched in sweat. It's 98 degrees out at the moment. I've tried everything I can think of. I thought maybe it has overheated so I turned it off for half an hour but made no difference. I can't afford a new ac already but it's looking like I'm going to have to buy one. I'm updating my review the day after I posted it. As soon as the outdoor temperature started going down the unit was able to stay on for longer periods of time. As soon as it was back in the 80s instead of hovering around 100 I stopped having problems and the unit has worked fine since. I assume it was just to much for it to cool the space it previously had no trouble with once it became dangerously hot out.

These have a hard broad nib and a thin nib. There's a really nice variety of colors but some are close in color. The set does come with a blending marker. The caps indicate the color but unfortunately they are not close in color and I suggest you make a chart for referencing them. I also suggest writing the color number on the barrel itself because the names and do rub off after very little use. These markers do tend to last for a reasonable amount of time and are great for basic illustration, indoor temporary signs coloring and more. They are permanent markers. These markers are not Lightfast at all, a sign I created for a door began fading after a few weeks and had to be replaced after a 2 months or so as it faded so much so it was almost difficult to read. If using for signage I would suggest it be limited to indoor and outdoor of direct sunlight. These markers are good markers when work (I do have other sets of the Touch series and there wasn't any issues), but because so many we're dried out I was disappointed with them hence 3 stars.

The pictures show the suction cup to be on side of bag when you vacuum but since you can\u2019t fill it that full in actuality it ends up 2/3 of the way across the top and sucking against the other side of plastic instead of against whatever you have in the bag. So then you have to open it again and arrange the placement of the suction cup area so that this doesn\u2019t happen. I had to open it and take some yarn out 3 times before it would fit the outer bag so it only sucked my yarn down about 4 or 5\u201d total whereas the pictures show your stuff being about double the size of the outer bag and not just 4 or 5 inches. I think I can fit just as much yarn in a hard plastic bin without near the trouble of having to repack and vacuum this thing several times wasting hours of my time that could have been done in minutes with a regular plastic bin. I thought yarn being so fluffy would have been easier than the blankets which also took me several tries and hours of time but it wasn\u2019t any easier. Not good to use when you are trying to pack quickly to move that is for sure. And now I still have the things I had to take out to get it to fit within the outer bag to pack in some other way. These bags might be ok to use if you weren\u2019t trying to get the inner bag to shrink down enough to fit within the outer bag. Wish I had just bought regular space bags now because these are so much trouble. Also the L size bag actually holds less than the M size because the plastic bag gets smaller as you go up instead of staying at the same size opening as at the bottom of the bag and pulls everything inward causing problems packing it.

I tried installing both \"bells\" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how \"weatherproof\" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.", "review_title": "Easy to install?????", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

Moen has excellent customer service and is sending me a repair kit, but in another four years or so I assume the replaced parts will also have worn out.

Because it is plastic really, it does not \"hold together,\" that is, when folded it tends to slide apart and past itself, so using folded into like a smaller sponge is not so easy as expected. Holds liquid soap well but rinses clean easily. Might be difficult to travel with if not fully dried before packing as water will drip out until completely dry, different from something like a cotton washcloth that might just get and stay damp. Very little problem so far with strings coming loose, only one. While it holds water well when washing, the fibers do not actually absorb the water so little issue with mildew, mold, or just getting grungy. I am sure someone will ask about machine washing: I would expect that hot water might soften it, and the agitation, with other items would likely turn it into a puff ball of loose fibers that you might never fully get out of other items.

I loved it for the 10 days that it was hanging nicely on the wall... but during a very cold night - not sure if the cold affected this or not - we heard a huge crash. We found, to our great surprise, the clock laying on the floor! When I laid the clock on a flat surface, my husband (who was sitting at eye level to the counter) said that it was bowed. Sure enough, the whole clock was warped!! There was no way to hang it back on the wall. So, we returned it to Amazon. I was so upset because I really loved how this clock looked. Perhaps we got a dud? I would really like to buy this clock again, but I can't trust the quality of the product.... if you buy it, I hope that your wood stays flat and you can enjoy your beautiful clock. When we first hung up the clock, I noticed the back had two pieces of wood tacked across. This was for stability, I suppose - probably to stop bowing, but in our case it didn't work. The wood 'bumps' made it a bit awkward to hang the clock in the first place, but we did hang it correctly using the hole on the mechanism part. I think that for our clock the wood must have been slowly warping and eventually got to the point where it popped itself off the wall.

So I ordered this. Woah - I pretty much locked myself out at the gym because I didn't realize how difficult it would be to see the numbers - black numbers against a silver, reflective surface! It took me several minutes and a few failed attempts. The lights in the locker room bounce off the silver background, making it very difficult to see. I would love the lock and give it 5 stars if they had white numbers on a dark background. My TSA lock is that and the numbers are considerably smaller but I can read them without any problems. I don't wear glasses (except readers), so it's not that so much as the reflective surface.

The device was easy to set up as this is not the first camera similar to this that I have purchased and used. First my expectations were met with regard to the camera picture quality. Very good wide angle and picture quality is great in bright light. In the dark the IR LEDs provide plenty of light to make for a good picture quality. The problem is that the IR LEDs are VERY visible and they do NOT turn off. The app provides what seems to be a way to change the intensity of the IR LEDs from dark to bright, but this does nothing. Also, even when set to automatic in the app, the IR LEDs stay on. Even though the IR LEDs are set in the shape of the Bluetooth \"B\" logo any one who has any tech savvy about them will immediately notice the IR LEDs as just that, IR LEDs for a camera. So it is highly possible someone is going to know it is a hidden camera. If the IR LEDs could be turned off completely to use the camera in only a brightly lighted place, that would be great, but as I said these IR LEDs do NOT turn off at all unless you turn off the device. Also the setting in the app to only record when the motion alarm is triggered does not work. They are two seperate settings. In the app I set the motion detection alarm to alert me if motion and that part works. The recording options allow you to record ALL the time, Only during a scheduled time or only when motion is detected. The camera does NOT automatically start recording when motion is detected no matter how I configure the settings in the APP. So I am left to let it record all the time. All in all, I give it only 2 stars because of the IR LED and record on motion detection issue. I have another camera that works flawlessly exactly how I want it to, but they are no longer available, otherwise I would have just bought that same one. If they fix these issues, I have no doubt this unit would be 4 or 5 stars.", "review_title": "Not really \"Concealed\" Camera and does not record on motion detection", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

The only complaints I have for the unit is the coarse/fine adjust knob is tricky to use so as not to damage the milling cones, which the instructions say will happen if the unit is operated without seeds. But can happen even with seeds, at the start of milling, if the knob is set too fine, before the seeds actually enter the milling cone. The method I use to prevent this, is to set the knob to a coarser setting, then start milling to get the seeds into the mill cone, discard this material. Then start turning to finer settings as the crank is operated. This way, the stainless steel milling cone teeth will never come in contact with each other, thereby damaging them, as the seed material is acting as a barrier.

I ordered a dif one last week but returned it because it seemed to bang around and was also flimsy. This one was easy to assemble, and there were no rough edges, mismatched holes or missing hardware. Instructions easy, but it's so simple you don't really need them. I took another reviewers advice and put the rungs from largest on top to smallest on bottom and like how that works, allows a bit more drying space. There is of course some minor movement of the rack because the bottom isn't fastened down, but following another reviewer's advice, put some leftover rug pad fabric under the top hooks to get a snug, quiet fit and to keep from scratching the paint. Also, as mentioned by yet another reviewer, I ordered some little stick on cushions, but didn't h ave them yet, i just used the tiny little square band-aids on all of the protruding screws on back and it worked great. I might just leave them since they don't show. (all the screws are in the back, at least 12 of them, and they all stick out from the frame and will scratch up the finish on your door with the movement of adding and removing towels.) So, now no scratching of the paint and also is quieter, no banging and all the connections are tight. If you put a bath size towel on this, you'll have to fold in it half, so not great if you want it for drying. But works great for washcloths and hand towels spread out to dry. Will update if any change, but this simple rack i think is better than the other choices.
