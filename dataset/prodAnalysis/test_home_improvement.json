It has a nice (antique bronze) finish and goes well with my light saddle color leather sofas.

(It\u2019s possible I read that under another lamp\u2019s description.) This wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for me, for this lamp looks really fitting in this large room with its grand presence. Was easy enough to assemble and wanted it inbetween instead of behind the sofas. I have it sitting on top of a little 1ft drawer pedestal to give it just enough height to avoid bumping into the shades hanging. The base is very weighted to give it ample stability.

Easy to install. Have used several times now and still are getting a slight smell when the heating element warms up. We've had 2 different oven thermometers in the oven each time we've used and have discovered that this heating element heats up 25 degrees less that what we set the oven for. Again, not a huge deal since we just set the oven 25 degrees higher than what we want it. I guess it could be an issue if you didn't have an oven thermometer to double check on your temp.

The mechanism doesn't have the option of being able to open the door from the inside while locked. On the outside, unlocking the door with the key is in the opposite direction of the handle's direction to open the door. The key unlocks by turning counter clockwise and then you have to turn the lever clockwise to open the door. These things might sound minor, but do it multiple times a day and it gets old.

Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long.

I have had mine outside for nearly a year and there are 4 issues with it: 1) The screws are not rustproof! Since this is supposed to be a \"waterproof\" box it doesn't help if the screws used almost immediately start to rust after getting wet. The 4 screws are also counter sunk into top of box. This allows water to sit in the screw holes if you mount this flat like the picture shows. 2) The screws thread into the plastic itself. If you need to open and close this somewhat frequently you are likely to strip the plastic threads. 3) You are likely to lose the screws since the screws do not stay attached to the lid when opening the box like some other boxes. 4) Box is starting to yellow after being out in sun for almost year.

Well, I found the answer. First, the lever had to be cut to fit so it wouldn't hit the refill tube...that I was ready for. But then I discovered that there was no way the square rubber gasket would fit into the square hole in the tank, it was way too tight. I ended up putting it in from the inside, and was able to tighten up the plastic nut enough to hold the handle assembly securely. The handle on the old, stock unit, which lasted 15 years, was made of pot-metal, and the little pocket that the lever fits into had split open at the pressure/wear point. The new handle is made of plastic, with a slightly different cam mechanism. I would bet that it won't last nearly as long...time will tell. The bottom line: Spend the extra $10-12 to get a more durable handle that you can install in about 2 minutes with no jury-rigging hassles.", "review_title": "Dont bother", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for \"breastfeeding\" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product!

One went out within 6 months, the other went out about a month ago. I have other bulbs in similar conditions which have lasted many years. I am disappointed in the short life of these. I have adjusted my overall rating down because of this problem. Original Review: These does exactly what I want them to do: they turn off in daylight, and on in darkness. I was skeptical because when I opened the package and looked at the bulbs, I could not find a photo sensor \u2026 so I expected these to stay on all the time, contrary to the claim. But, even though I couldn't find the photo sensor, it must be there. These do indeed turn on at night and off in the morning. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were described as \"cool white\". I'd describe them as \"blue-white\". (I'll take some of the blame for this, though, because the description did say 6000K, and I didn't pay enough attention to that. I wish I'd gotten the 3000K version.)

But the actual rebuild process is NOT for the faint of heart. Taking apart my toilet and removing the old flush kit was really demanding and I don\u2019t recommend it - whoever installed my old one overtightened every locknut - but a lot of people overtighten stuff and you\u2019ll probably encounter the same. I had to melt and break the big plastic locknut below the tank, it simply could not be removed by hand (and nobody has a wrench that big!). Once all that is done, the rebuild with this kit is actually not too bad, and the directions are good. I had to get creative a couple times (nobody has a hacksaw!), but I got through it. The final part, reattaching the tank and whatnot, is actually also tricky because you want to get it even on both sides, water tight, and you probably have other stuff in your bathroom like a sink and a tub and walls and it\u2019s hard to get your head in there to see what you\u2019re doing. I think I did mine imperfectly, because for the first few weeks there would be a small leak (just a couple tablespoons of water) seeping from between the tank and the base. Not upon flushing, but gradually over 8-12 hours and then I\u2019d give it wipe. I thought I\u2019d have to remove and reattach the tank again, but then the leak just stopped? I guess things evened out with time, gravity and dumb luck. Seriously. A month now with no leaks. Like I said, my toilet works great now. By all accounts it shouldn\u2019t. I am *somewhat* handy (building ikea furniture is so much fun! I can change the wiper blades, tires, and tail lights on my car! I own basic tools!)- handier than a typical millennial - and very tenacious, and while I recommend this flush kit, I do not recommend that you install it by yourself unless you are handier than me. Before you say something sexist, I installed this flush kit while 13 weeks pregnant, so I was simultaneously growing a human when I did it, and trust me I still did it better than a lot of men could.

I went and got my fireplace thermostat and brought it out to the garage for comparison - after 15 minutes the fireplace thermostat read 70 (correct temp), but this thermostat still said 56.

The \"buttons\" are wayyy too close for my slender female fingers so the lamp gets confused on what I'm pressing. I can't imagine how difficult this would be for man fingers. I often have to attempt pressing the button 5 - 6 times. Frustrating!!! I've been using this lamp for three weeks now. Overall, I like it. It doesn't tilt over from being top heavy which was what concerned me. Although the entire thing is very light, the arms (all parts above the base) are exceedingly light. I understand it's made of aluminum so that explains the weight. Very functional just as advertised. It doesn't really hurt my eyes because of the tilt function and move-ability of the two lamp arms. But selection of lowest to second lowest on brightness is a huge difference and I wish there was an in-between instead of the big jump. I gave it a 4 rather than 5 star rating because I feel there's room for improvement, but for the price, it's not bad.", "review_title": "Functional, but needs improvement.", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

It's too soon to know if it saves me any money. There was a small bit of confusion in the wiring diagrams supplied : the main manual indicates that Terminals 1 and 3 need to be connected by a jumper wire and also Terminals 2 and 5. However, in the small enclosed package that has the jumper wires is a sheet that shows Terminals 1 and 5 to be connected and also Terminals 2 and 3. The problem is the supplied jumper wires are too short and those latter connections are impossible to make. It's a little confusing that there are two different jumper connection shown in the paperwork with the product. I went with the one that the wires were long enough to actually work with. In practice I suspect it doesn't matter. Beyond that confusion, the rest of the install was straight forward. Programming is pretty easy, the display however is rather small and you have to look at it closely. Doubling the size of the LCD would be nice ! The buttons were not as smooth as they could be. Sometimes a light press resulted in nothing happening and it was necessary to press rather firmly to get the display to change as expected. But once the setup is done, these don't have to be touched again unless the program needs to be altered. It is very easy to bring the water heater on out of cycle by just pushing the large button that is accessible without opening the timer door. It then stays on until the next programmed off cycle or until a user pushes the button again.

Unacceptable - why do they still make and sell such defective designs? The Touch 'N Hold Smooth product title says it all. The door motion is completely uniform with no initial jump. Smooth as it is, the closing rate is still on the brisk side. I would prefer an overall more leisurely closure rate.

It was amazingly easy to install and I was actually really impressed at how perfectly aligned the magnets were. For such a \"cheap\" product, I had expected them to be at least slightly closer together or farther apart than the switch plate screws. When I started to apply the cover, it practically snapped into place on its own upon getting within a half or quarter of an inch away from the plate. The magnets are the perfect strength for the job--weak enough that it takes no effort to remove when you are ready to remove it, but strong enough that accidentally swiping your hand over the switch out of habit does not cause it to fall off, and strong enough that it takes no effort to apply. My fianc\u00e9 recently installed a lot of Phillips Hue smart bulbs in the house and it's been fun and convenient to be able to automate our lights and control them with voice commands--the only problem is the light switch must remain on at all times and turning the switch off also resets our saved brightness defaults. We both kept accidentally flipping switches to lights on the home network, and I came across these nifty covers and ordered a couple. They don't look out of place over the existing plates and they were very effective at preventing us from accidentally flipping the switches we wanted left on. I'll definitely be ordering more since we just moved to a new place and my fianc\u00e9 keeps accidentally flipping the garbage disposal switch that is next to one of the kitchen light switches.
