I used an oven mitt to hold the thermometer. It took all of 1 minute. If the gap was towards the bottom, then maybe dry ice is necessary? Mine was towards the top. I suppose the only way around this issue is to not order from Amazon, but in a brick and mortar store so you can inspect for gaps and where they probably kept it vertical at all times and probably removed any gap themselves before putting it on the shelves. Tho it does include a pretty case, the plastic container it was shipped in seems fine as a holder for the thermometer and that is what I am using.

I even had one print fail due to the mess of trying to bridge across supports and leaving blobs. I have been printing with other brands of PETG with little to no problems. at this point I will probably go back to what has been working. UPDATE!!!

I am also running 100% fan. even with the fan I seem to get really nice and strong prints but still have some problems with very fine detail as I get stringing. also my bridging problem seems to be allot better with the fan on. I upped the rating from 1 star to 4 as I am still seeing little problems here and there with prints that I try to fix.

These casters do NOT have t-nuts. They do have nuts attached, presumably to tighten the caster once screwed into the leg. T-nuts provide a layer of integrity to each leg so the casters don't chew up the wood inside the leg with repeated movement. Ergo, I will be buying the t-nuts to prolong the life of the legs of the side table I am putting these casters on. Casters are the right size and made well enough for my purposes.
