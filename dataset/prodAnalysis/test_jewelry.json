I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it!

It's beautiful! I ordered the plain stainless, and when I received it I placed an order for another in rose. Mine did not come with a red box, but I don't care about that. It is engraved inside. The screws that fasten the bracelet work well, and I was able to put it on myself with no trouble. The only thing I worried about was which size to order. My wrists measure about 6 1/2\" around, however I personally prefer bangle style bracelets to be a bit looser than link style bracelets, so I ordered the 7\" bracelet and it fits exactly how I like it, just a little room to spare and move around my wrist a bit. The places on the inside of the bracelet where the screws are do not bother me at all. I wear it next to my steel watch and it looks fabulous! Since receiving it, I have slept and showered in it and have had no issues whatsoever.
