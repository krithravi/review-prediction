I only gave it 4 stars because the lid does not close tight. It does snap close on the sides but not by the handles. There is a good size gap and in order to keep the food from drying out, I had to put a piece of plastic wrap over the top of the pan and then put the lid over it. It did keep the food warm using the heated pack. If you lay the top on your counter, it does not lay flat but instead, the ends curve upward. I don't know if this was caused from packaging or it just is too small. I am now trying to flatten it out by setting the cover on the counter and putting the pan on top of it and let it sit for awhile to see if it that will flatten the cover out or not.

It's true that over time they do start to bend or warp a bit from the heat in the dishwasher, but I can use these for a couple of years or more before they need replacing. Also important to note that I've use this style cutting board for about 10 years now-my first set I had for about 5 years (warped and all) and I have never actually cut THROUGH one of these boards. They are surprisingly durable and I replaced them only because they got so warped that juices kept running off the board onto the counter and I decided it was time to let go. My other favorite thing about them is that it's so much easier to transfer the cut food from the board to the pot without dumping it all over the place because they bend to whatever shape you need and food slides down the narrow path you make for it instead of down on the burner or stove top.

Looking through the choices, this seemed to be the best choice for me. 1. The distiller was packaged well and highly unlikely to be damaged in shipping. 2. I laughed when I looked at the instructions. There was an item list and the instructions you see here for the item but nothing about putting it together. The small foldout had multiple pages, but that was for the different languages. There were three QR codes for viewing YouTube instructional videos. I had to download a QR code reader. Then, the third QR code linked to the middle QR codes videos. If you purchase this, save your time and do a YouTube video search for Life Basic and the title above each QR code. Now, this version has slight differences from the ones shown on YouTube, but they are close enough. 3. Putting the handle on the glass carafe was a bit of a challenge and it was much easier with two people. This was one of the two items that necessitated viewing the YouTube video. The metal bands are wrapped around the carafe opposite how they are packaged. The video shows a long metal screw and a nut. This version had two four screws, one for each side of the top and bottom bands. You'll need a medium size Phillips head screwdriver. I suspect the change was to eliminate the wrench required to hold the nut when connecting the bands. 4. Finding where the filter went also required viewing the video. I doubt I would have figured it out without a lot of trial and error. There was only one filter but I bought extra. 5. The first video clearly shows how to set up the system. It is really helpful when figuring out the reference to the silicon seal around the top of the glass in the carafe. 6. You do NOT connect the power cord until you are ready to start the distilling process. Put the water in, connect the distiller cord to the base, put the carafe in place, and then pull in the power cord. There is no on/off switch. 7. The process takes a bit over three hours as the water drips into the carafe. As per the instructions, it takes about 30 minutes for the process to start. There is some warmth but it is not hot to the touch. 8. Once done, I poured the distilled water into a large glass container like you would use for sun tea or lemonade. 9. Let it cool for a few minutes and then wipe out the base, the bottom of the distiller, and since I'm moving the water to an easier to use glass container, the carafe. Then, let all the parts air dry thoroughly before putting it away. This is working well and I'm going to be happy to have an easy way of getting distilled water for a long time.", "review_title": "Working well so far", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I was excited to have a \u201cdo it all\u201d griddle, however I was disappointed. 1st ISSUE - I should have returned it after the first use when I realized you cannot cook scrambled eggs without them immediately sliding off into the grease trap. It baffles me - why would I want a more pricy griddle with separate units that you can\u2019t cook both eggs and bacon? Just know that anything with a liquid consistency CANNOT be cooked on this griddle. 2nd ISSUE- After the 2nd use, I realized that the temperature of the two plates did not operate correctly. When I turned down the upper unit (to keep pancakes warm) the lower unit stopped cooking and would not readjust back to set temperature until the upper unit was increased to the same temperature. 3RD & 4TH ISSUES - Also upon 2nd use, two other things surfaced. I realized that the upper unit doesn\u2019t lie down completely flat on the counter surface so it remains sloped even when in the unlocked position. I readjusted to allow the end of the unit to be slightly off the counter. Which is when I realized that the I could no longer see the dials. Over all I do not recommend this unit for those reasons.

Given Amazon's usually great value on its \"Basics\" line, I thought I'd be getting higher quality glasses with a more aesthetic design and thinner glass.... similar to a Riedel glass, but at a much better price point. In reality, these are average quality, consumer-grade wine glasses made with fairly thick glass that most serious wine drinkers do not desire. Given the Cyber Monday price of $15 for four glasses, I won't send them back since they are technically not defective. In terms of relative value, I have found MUCH higher quality glasses at Costco at a better price point -- ones that I am comfortable using on an everyday basis, but not embarrassed to use when pouring excellent wines for friends/family.", "review_title": "Just OK...

I\u2019ve been making my own bread for over 50 years, and have had the original Zojirushi bread machine for over 20 years. When it died a week ago I researched carefully before I chose the Virtuoso Plus. Make no mistake, it\u2019s expensive and big and heavy (I needed help from my son to get it into my house and set up). However, once set up it was a breeze to use, and the finished product - a basic white bread - turned out to be possibly the absolute best loaf of bread I\u2019ve ever made, including when compared to hand-kneaded, oven-baked loaves. The double blades do a superior job of kneading the dough, and the additional top heating element result in a superior finished product. Really an exceptional loaf of bread. Also, this machine is very versatile, beyond baking bread. There are a number of websites that describe a range of oven-type foods that can be baked in bread machines, and with the additional top heating element, the possibilities are expanded. So happy I chose this machine! I took one star off my rating because the display is more challenging than it needs to be, with no back-lighting (I have to use a flashlight to read it), and being located on the top of the unit rather than on the front, as it was on my old Zo. That\u2019s especially annoying if you\u2019re short, like me. In fact I had to disqualify most of the other machines on the market because they didn\u2019t even have a slanted display but only had a display located squarely on the top. At least the Zo Virtuoso Plus has a slightly slanted display, so I don\u2019t have to stand on anything to program the settings. What are manufacturers thinking? Do they think most users are giants?

Two days after I initiated the return I found a collar piece that sits between the hopper and the Burr. It just sits there mind you. It must have fallen off when I unpacked it from the box. Now, when it wouldn't grind correctly I must have read the instructions a dozen times to see if I missed something. The company must consider this small collar, that just sits on there, part of the grinder because it was not listed anywhere. Basically it was just \"put the hopper on, add beans, and go.\" If it had been listed as a part, or at least a footnote to make sure it was sitting there, I could have saved myself a headache. That's why I knocked off a star on this updated review. All that being said, now that I have it assembled correctly it works like a charm.

Mugs have NEVER been dropped nor handled roughly. The mugs I received were packed two to a box with only a thin wrap of styrofoam around each mug but nothing protecting the mug's top and bottom... only the cardboard material of the shipping container. As such, exposure to shock/breakage is maximized in these areas and exactly where the damage I noticed occurred. But I did not closely inspect the mugs upon unpacking.

Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target.

You can divide the top lunch box in two so I think it is very useful. I generally put fruits and veggies on top. The only negative thing about this lunch box is when I received my packet I realized there was a very small crack (picture is attached) on the top part of the lunch box. I could request a new one but I do not think it would cause any problems and it is hard to see it.

It's long, curved with a disc-shaped collar that together would help save your hand from hot (potentially scalding) water while cleaning your expresso machine group head at several angles. HOWEVER, the bristles are so stiff and tightly packed with rough flat edges that it might as well be a stiff wire brush or a block of metal or wood. Instead of dislodging coffee grounds from the machine's group head it is likely to push them up into the holes insuring serious clogging with repeated use. It's like shoving or pushing the grounds up into the tiny holes. The more you use it the worst it will be. A clogged machine will require profesional attention or expensive thorough cleaning. Ironically the stiff bristles come \"protected\" inside a plastic cap. Maybe is to protect the plastic bag from the brushes. Perhaps these might be good to clean a toilet bowl rim or the inside of metal drain pipes. My first reaction was to throw them in the garbage and make sure to avoid products from this maker and vendor.

When I got my toaster I immediately notice two things. One, it had some scuffs on it and it also was missing the blue protective wrap that should have been on it. The only reason I knew it was wrapped at one time was that there was pieces of the wrap stuck in the cracks. This leads me to believe that someone else owned this toaster and returned it to the seller. I decided to just keep it as it was a cheap toaster and I didn't want to send it back. Well, I found out why someone returned the item in the first place. The heating elements on the inside of both slots did not work. They would only toast one side. Before I realized this I tried using the bagel setting. That only burnt the outside and did not toast the inside. Isn't that the whole purpose of a bagel setting? To toast the inside and not the outside? I understand that even the best products can turn out to lemons from time to time but I feel like this company knowingly tried to deceive me by selling me a used defective toaster.

Use extreme caution when handling-they will cut even with the lightest accidental touch :(. Lastly, don't overfill the liquid line on the blender, it is no joke and you'll have a mess all over the counter. Love the suction cups on the bottom of the unit to stabilize it on the counter top. All pieces are easy to clean, just throw in the dishwasher. The blade pieces are a little harder to clean and you will need to use the brush, especially if you're using the processor for dough. It gets stuck inside the bottom and can be challenging to get out. These are all minor issues compared to the benefits you get out of owning one of these.

Wish the base was black though, so it would've matched my other Dash products -- their larger blender and an egg cooker. The negative -- the blade cover uses a silicon o ring to seal with the container and it comes of too easily and did so without warning. On our fourth day of use, the o ring came loose during blending and decided to wrap and ruin itself on the blades.

The second and more concerning issue is the reservoir is easy to overfill as the reservoir design makes it difficult to see the water level. I would suggest measuring the water in the carafe and then pouring it into the reservoir. The concerning thing is my wife filled it using a Britta pitcher and probably put in about 10 cups and when the maker transitioned from heating to brewing the maker kept popping the GFCI outlet. Moved it to a different outlet as I was thinking the outlet might have been overly sensitive. This GFCI outlet blew as well.

The sheer cost savings and safety of DIY capsule filling pushed me to buy this product. I buy my supplements in bulk.

I shook the bottom caps in, only 3 were upside down. Pressed on the spring loaded tray to get them to raise up, the grabbed them with the tweezers to flip. Easy. Took 10 min to fill 100 caps and snap the tops on. Done and done. I'm filling with coral calcium, MSM and another batch was tumeric extract. Works like a champ. Directions were good. I'm retired military so the clear and direct instructions were great. For efficiency, buy caps that are pre seperated. I didn't, but sat and watched TV the night before and seperated them out. I only saved a few bucks buying the non seperated caps. So maybe spend a few bucks more and save yourself some time. If your looking for a fast capsule filler, this is it. Just buy it.

I got this at the very end of December. It is now April 19th and the hotter burner shined gloriously bright. I turned off the heat because it began turning YELLOW not red like normal and I thought it was gonna burst into flames. But alas, when I tried to turn it back on, she wouldn't heat up. The smaller, much less useful burner works still but after using this every day exclusively for about four months, its basically dead. I would say half dead but that smaller burner isn't good for cooking much. So why four star rating? Because I abused the crap outta this little cooktop feeding my family of six with it. Four months of HARD use is, IMO, great for a cook top this cheap. Now will I get it again? Maybe someday when my primary cooking element is my stove and not an electric cook top... But this will give you years of use for occasional use for such a small price. Until we meet again. RIP. So Pros: -Cheap -Lasts four months worth of breakfast, lunch, and dinner cooking so for the occasional use it'll last a LONG time. -Gets really hot fairly quick for an electric cook top. -Easy to use -adequate space between burners for two pots or pans -hides dirt well lol Cons: -obviously not good for heavy everyday use -grates do not lift for cleaning -numbers on knobs wore off quickly -for some reason easy to forget it's still on (may have to do with lights cycling on and off) Conclusion: excellent price for an excellent cook top for years of OCCASIONAL use, but not a good cooktop for long term heavy use.", "review_title": "It worked great until it didn't.", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

So far I have made two pot roasts and brown rice both times. My first pot roast I slow cooked for 4 hours from frozen and it came out great. Second time tried a roast with veggies and cooked it for 8 hours and that worked great too. Please read the cheat sheet that comes in the box. If you read the cheat sheet, you don't cook Brown Rice using the \"Rice\" setting, You have to cook it on \"Pressure Cook\" for 20 minutes with the pressure valve closed and do a quick release. Then the brown rice comes out perfect. The cooker has a stainless steel pot that is super easy to clean. I just wipe, rinse or throw in the dishwasher. I love being able to cook using just one pot.

I do not use the black self lock bar because it puts a \"dent\" in my hair. I use the thin clips/pins from my old hot rollers. They slide easily over the roller and hold it in place. If I need more clips I order these: Pro Touch Assorted Hot Roller Clips, 12 Count. I half way dry my hair and then use the rollers. If it gets too dry I spritz with water. Then I use the blow dryer to dry each roller. I put on my makeup, get dressed and then they are dry and I take them out and have firm, long lasting curls. BTW, i do use gel on my wet hair.

Been looking for a nice small vacuum cleaner just for cleaning my car and after reading other reviews and watching a couple videos others have posted, this was more of an impulse buy. I was hestitant that this would power effectively and have good suction given it draws power from the cars DC outlet. But I am blown away! It's good looking, powerful, lightweight, has all the same attachments you'd find in your everyday vacuum at home and does indeed suck! It powers on immediately, has an adequate sound volume, not too loud. This vacuum although does have a couple short comings. The swiveling brush attachment is half assed. It helps get stuck in dirt, but when you try to brush, the head just flops around when you try to use even the slightest of pressure. With that said, I've had to use my free hand to hold the brush head itself just to get the tougher areas to brush and vacuum so that was a little annoying. Secondly, the cord could be a little longer. It does come with a nice cord but even for use in a compact car like my Hyundai Elantra, the back seat was as far as the cord would allow for vacuuming with decent slack. I wouldnt be able to use the vacuum to clean the trunk. The cord only allows for the vacuum to reach just outside the door. Of course this does depend on make and model so not everyone may have the same problem. Some people may have a dc outlet in their trunk that the can clean it if they wish. My car however, does not. It has one up front in the lower center stacked console. The last thing to dislike is that this may be made just for cars, BUT, the vacuum cord has a dc outlet plug only, it doesn't have an AC plug or a converter attachment. So when you buy this remember that it will only power through the DC outlet, unless you would want to use a third party DC to AC power converter. Also i tested this while I had my engine on, so the car would cycle power efficiently and not alone on accessory power for it would drain the battery quickly as insurance that the next time I go to start my car, it would start.

This one solidly fits the bill; however, the first shipment was missing the handrails and tote bag (which I returned), and the second shipment was missing the rubber cap for one of the legs. Amazon was great in every step, but I feel the company needs better quality control when shipping items out. We did receive a new rubber cap within a short time. Back to the ladder, hubby and I feel quite safe and secure while going up and down the four steps. (Hint; be sure to count going down because hubby did a misstep and almost tumbled, trying to step down too early.) The other suggestion is after two weeks of use putting items away in our new kitchen, I've noticed the bolts to the handrails need to be tightened. Other than the missing parts in two separate shipments, I believe I would have given 5 stars for this handy, dandy ladder!", "review_title": "Ladder is great, but company needs better quality control", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I don't care about the \"kitchen gadgets,\" either because it's always a pain to wash and store. BUT I must admit that washing and storing this chopper is definitely worth the price. It comes with a brush and a little \"claw\" thing to help get all out of the top portion and it works pretty well. I haven't used all the blades yet, but it's sharp what I used and it doesn't take a lot of effort. You need to cut the larger vegetables half or quarter to make sure they fit on the blade, but that's better than chopping the whole thing. I also like the size of the container. Plenty of room for 2 or 3 onions or all of the salad vegetables. I got carried away chopping vegetables for a salad for 2 and ended up with salad for 4! The lid is nice too making it easy to store the chopped vegetables for later.", "review_title": "Perfect", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}
