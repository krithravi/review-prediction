Much to my chagrin, I noticed shortly after moving in that the prior owners did not take the carpenter ants that live in the deck with them. It's now a war. I've used this DE inside a home years ago with good results, so I bought this one again. I first studied the ants to see where they were coming from and where they were going. After gathering the necessary intel, I sprinkled the DE everywhere I'd seen the ants, as well as in all the cracks and crevices of the deck. I didn't use any special equipment...I went to the dollar store and bought a large plastic container with a lid and punched a bunch of holes in the top for sprinkling. I also bought one of those condiment bottles to shoot the DE in the crevices. Both work perfectly. Spent $2 for dispensers, so keep that in mind if you're eyeing expensive equipment. It's been two weeks and I'm still seeing ants; far, far fewer, but I am still seeing them come and go. I've started becoming much more heavy-handed with the DE. Instead of sprinkling it (rather heavily), I'm covering areas with it. Ants won't cross a line of the powder, so I make sure it comes out several inches from the deck supports, etc. I've seen ants walk thru it and go back in the way they came. I suspect the reason I'm still seeing them is that the nest is where I can't get to it, so it's going to take a while to get enough of the buggers exposed to this stuff to get the whole nest. Watch out when spreading this stuff around...it floats around in the air for quite a while. I ended up getting it in my eyes and all over my clothes (yes, the instructions say to wear protective gear). I'm only giving this 3 stars for now. As I said, it's been two weeks, and I'll come back in another couple of weeks or so with an update to let you know if this has evicted the tenants living in my deck.", "review_title": "We'll see", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

I wiggled the pump power cord and bam...there was life. Since I am mechanically inclined, I tore it apart right down to the bones. White power cable from the relay box was too short and got pinched when assembled. It has a hole to go through, but since it was to short someone crammed it into a spot that cut the power to the pump. I fixed the wire issue and now it works well.

The interior peak of the roof is about 25 feet high and the loft floor is about 10 feet above the main floor. So I set this product up with the recommended settings and plugged it into an extension cord and laid it flat on it's back on the loft floor in about the middle of the barn and pointed the speakers towards the peak of the roof. I could immediately hear the bats chattering so I thought this is going to work great. The next day I returned and some of the bats, maybe 10 of them, had moved to the outside of the barn under the eaves. So I stayed until dusk to see if they still flew out of the roof and on the end of the roof where the loft is they did not but on the other end where the height of the peak of the roof is 25' they did (about 10 or so I think). So I'm thinking I either need another one of these for that end of the barn despite the claim that this product covers 5,000 sf (which it does not) or this product just isn't strong enough to transmit a loud enough sound 25' away to drive the bats out. So I think this product would work in small, open attics.

Oh and so NOT water tight, especially if the doors will face sprinklers or wind driven rain... it stays pretty dry inside but does get wet here and there. Assembly was pretty easy... a BIG tip is to NOT use electric screw drivers... use a hand tool or I guarantee you will strip the thin soft wood unless you are VERY skilled with the battery/electric ones. 2nd tip give the preinstalled screws a twist, they will all be loose... in fact you might want to drop by the hardware store and grab a few extra as installing a couple more here and there would improve things... as would flat and 'L' brackets but not seriously needed, just nice. Have a nice LEVEL place to place it as it will shift to the point the doors jam if not level. I gave mine a coat of water seal just for giggles so maybe it will last a bit longer.

I specifically looked for a small POP UP canopy, which based on the description, this sounded like what I needed. However, when I opened the box there were a bunch of poles, connectors, a tarp and a sheet with directions. If the poles are not connected when the box is opened, it is not a pop up!! The parts are do flimsy that each time I attempted to set up another leg the others fell apart. Not to mention that once you do get it up, the slightest breeze knocks it over even when fastened down. Taking it apart is even worse because you can't just collapse it in on itself, you have to remove all of the poles from each other and from the plastic connectors - very time consuming. Also, this should come with a storage bag as it contains 24 poles plus 9 plastic connectors, the tarp, tie down strings and metal stakes (which resemble short barbecue skewers in thickness.)", "review_title": "Should not be labeled as a pop up canopy!", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

However, all holes lined up with my ~30 year old base and the fit was fine.", "review_title": "Used Base Worked Great", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

Snap traps should be your first approach as they are fast and clean kill but when used correctly sticky traps can be valuable, especially in the case of young mice that won't set off snap traps due to how light they are. Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible! The horrible damage it does to wildlife is astronomical as it doesn't stop with the rodent but is passed on to every predator and scavenger in the ecosystem.", "review_title": "When snap traps fail this is a an acceptable second solution but ONLY when used with caution to protect wildlife and pets!", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

I should've thought of ordering a quart too but couldn't Amazon or the seller just put a gentle reminder (like.. batteries not included for all kids toys - oh so no reminder necessary for man toys)? So I head to the local Lowe's and get a quart of Husqvarna bar and chain oil... why is the \"Oregon oil\" that Amazon bundles with the tool so expensive? Anyway... once I got everything set up off I go trim the palm trees in the hot sun. Works great or as good as I expected. I could use a bit more than the 30 deg maximum head tilt angle for navigating through all the leaves and getting a good hold - instead I had to move the ladder a few more times. Not sure how one gets 14 ft total reach.. feels a bit shorter to me. Guess if it was any longer it might be too top-heavy to use. The way it is it works fine but I was at the top step of my ladder. For trimming tree leaves and branches, this seems as good as it gets. Less than 2 hours and I was done with 3 trees, including pulling cables and cleaning up. The last time I did this with a pair of loppers I got 1 and 1/2 trees done in the same time before I was too exhausted to finish it.

To the Company please do more stitching and maybe heavier material closer sewn & if the bottom material was little thicker it last longer. I do like just up grade. We will pay extra for quality to last longer. Going to have to sew my new 2 , Sadly already May just been flaws idk. But those are disappointing.

I was very satisfied with the work done. The assembler went an extra mile to fix leaks (see photos). But unfortunately it still leaks at the midpoint of each side. After a year, I feel I can write a fair review. The structure is certainly sturdy and withstood a Connecticut winter. Even so, the problem with the leaks is an annoyance. I called the seller and was advised about caulking it. The assembler had done that, but he could not figure out how to get the water to go down the corner channels and not leak at the center point screws on each side. Here is the problem. One of the sides is next to my sliding glass door. The slow drip causes a puddle. I have now also discovered that as vegetation accumulated this spring in the gutters around the sides it acted as a sponge. So that even after it stops raining, I get a slow drip from the water retained in the debris. I cleaned out the gutters to eliminate that problem, but that did not solve the midpoint leak problem. The seller was notified of this problem last year. They did not send a technician out to solve the problem that I as a consumer am not able to fix. If this were a small item, I'd return it. The four leaks might not be an issue if placed out on a lawn. One other flaw is that the metal structure do not come with caps at the ends. That could result in insects like bees infiltrating the tubes. So the bottom line is that I'm happy with this product until it rains. I enjoy the shade it provides. But the engineering design flaw leads me to not recommend it if the leaks may be a concern.

As it is smaller, it takes up less room on my 4 burner Camp Chef griddle and because it is smaller it also does a better job of helping cook the chicken and of keeping it warm once the chicken is cooked. These domes make for a small oven of sorts and when using a griddle are a must. I use this and my other domes to melt cheese on burgers, to steam vegetables, and to keep warm whatever I have cooked that I am not ready to take off the griddle. Of note is the fact that the handle may get hot, so caution is warranted when cooking with high temperatures and especially when used for long periods on a hot grill.

The weld point between the spiral and the pole cap looked a bit weak but held when tightening. I was going to paint these a rubbed bronze but after my first lighting the black soot made me hold off until I buy some soot-free fuel. Two things I would suggest: 1) Trim the wick down just a bit so the cap seals against the glass better. I didn't and now my fuel is cloudy and yellowed from wicking moisture from the air. 2) Add an overall rain cap to further protect the finish.

I am a professional landscaper and have been doing lawn care for over 20 years, I have never seen anything as easy to use as this machine. First impressions is that this equipment is light enough for anyone to use and easy to operate, though it does lack some power. Will cut through some thick vegetation with relative ease, but long grass tends to wrap around the head and shaft, especially if you take it too fast. The line that come with the unit does ok but takes a lot of power to use it. I changed the line worth desert vortex trimmer line and the cut was much better and allowed the engine to be used at about half throttle while doing normal trimming. Great product for anyone with a back injury like me as you do not have to carry the unit just push. I really like that I can trim under objects and that I never seem to have any grass on my legs when I am done.
