It should be noted here that I always travel with a down throw which takes up the same amount of space as one or maybe even two outfits. The side of the bag with the outside pocket must not be over-packed if you want to carry your laptop in that pocket without the chance of damage. It is not the type of suitcase that is easy to \"live\" out of due to the nature of hardside cases where the zipper splits the case in the middle. Which means that you need a large surface to open the case flat. (Usually, the floor) Take that into consideration when deciding between hard or soft side luggage.

I haven't flown with it yet, but will be using it as a carryon for a plane trip in a few months and will update my review then.

The BIG PROBLEM is the straps are exceptionally long and made it unusable. I'm a 5'7\" female and at the very shortest it was hanging on my bum. You can't even force the rest of the strap up through the plastic holder because the seam is too fat to go though.

If you are looking for a disposable set of luggage, this is it. The quality is equivalent to what's offered at your local discount store. The wheels are all plastic. The extended handle flexes a lot and the release button is sensitive so that the handle keeps retracting while you're wheeling through the airport. I've used the smaller bag as a carry on for a very short trip and it's already nicely scratched and dinged from a fall on the pavement. My guess is that rough handling by baggage check will likely be enough to break this set. On the positive side, the amount of storage is nice and the smaller bag held a weekend worth of clothes nicely with space to spare. The bag also fit well into the overhead compartment, but note that the smaller bag has no side handle - which I missed when lifting and lowering the bag. If you see this set for the Black Friday price again, consider it a maybe. But I definitely would not pay MSRP for this set.

My criteria was it had to have a trolley sleeve, be stylish and versatile enough to bring to the beach, roomy enough to fit my travel pillow, accessories, food and change of clothes, and zippered so my stuff doesn\u2019t fall out. This met all the criteria and I also loved that it has a flat bottom and is easy to clean, because I will be stowing this under the seat in front of me and we all know how disgustingly dirty planes are. The trolley sleeve keeps the bag together with the main bag more securely, so I can\u2019t wait to try this out. Some reviews have said it doesn\u2019t fit over the handle, but this is not a problem with my Eagle Creek roller bag. The only thing I think I would change are the handles, because they are kind of thin and may hurt if carrying heavier stuff as a tote, but I can deal with it and my solution would be to slip on some padded sleeves on the handle.", "review_title": "Found the Bag I am looking for", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

Swear I could fit my dog in this bag. Hate your job? Sneak a bottle of wine in this thing, no one will notice. Your coworkers will be asking why you brought an empty bag to work. And talk about stylish. This bag cost me $50 but has people asking if I drive a Rolls Royce. One guy asked if I was the CFO for Facebook. This thing makes you look like a million bucks. It\u2019s also the most durable bag I\u2019ve ever seen. I accidentally ran it along some sandpaper and turned it into card stock with no damage to the bag. In all seriousness though, very great bag.
