While the British Sound is a good deal overall, it just doesn't sound as good as the American Sound does (to me). This has nothing to do with how accurately it emulates a real Marshall amplifier (same thing with the American Sound), as opposed to how usable the sonic flexibility is when going straight into a (guitar) power amp. It's impossible to get a decent balance of bass/middle/treble frequency response, regardless of how clean or distorted the gain is set to. Along with that, there an unpleasant solid state-like harshness when the gain is set higher. While the American Sound isn't foolproof with how you can set it, there's a lot more usable sounds that are pleasing in a guitar amp way. Again, I have to stress that I'm using this pedal to be representative of a guitar amp's preamp, in its totality. If someone is just using this as an OD or distortion pedal, or if only using it as an emergency backup into the PA, it's probably potentially great for that. Also, the British Sound seems to have the potential (depending on where the gain is set) to have a much higher noise floor than the American Sound, too.", "review_title": "Not as good as the American Sound", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}

LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure. All in all, these are VERY minor complaints, compared to everything this device does so well. I highly recommend!", "review_title": "GREAT VALUE", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}
