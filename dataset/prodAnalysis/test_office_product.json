Mesh backs are always a plus in my opinion, so it has that I guess. Someone mentioned the neck support being useless because it would fall back with the slightest bit of pressure. This is not entirely true, you just have to have an extra allen wrench to counter-spin one side of the bolt while you tighten the other. While I was able to tighten it enough to use, I couldn't ever find a position for it that felt natural or useful for me. By far the worst part of the chair was the seat pad. Not nearly enough cushion for me. I'm 6'3\" and weigh about 215, so it may feel better for others that aren't as big. But for me, it felt like I was sitting on a metal plate after about 20-30 minutes. Having gone through several chairs in my time, I know the padding on these wears thin after sitting on them for 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week. The fact that this one hurt after such a short time period was a red flag.

The cotter pin is the funny looking skinny thing. Only three of my \"caps\" fit, but as long as you have twisted those cotter pins (you need a pair of needle nose pliers to separate the small part from the big part) and then twist them around in different directions to lock the wheel in place - do this to all four cotter pins.

We've got a spare room that is about 3 meters from the back wall to the other side, and I projected the image on the white wall. This produced a picture that was a little under 2 by 3 meters in size, almost covering the whole wall. With heavy curtains the room got pretty dark, and the image quality was good. Text was readable as well. This is not a projector for lit rooms, its lamp is too weak in that regard. On the plus side, I connected my ChromeCast to the HDMI-port and powered it from the built in USB-port, and that way it is very easy to set up - just one power cord and the rest is wireless. I connected my JBL Xtreme bluetooth-speaker using a mini-jack cable, and this made the movie experience really good, even though the built in speaker is good enough. I watched an action movie and was immersed in the action with the huge picture and good sound quality from the JBL. I also played some Minecraft with my daughter through our old Playstation 3, and this was just as enjoyable as film. If you are sitting in a quiet room the fan is pretty noisy, but when the movie is on it is less noticeable. I would recommend sitting at a distance from the unit itself though, if you can. All in all, very satisfied with the purchase. For the price it is good, and it suits my needs perfectly as a portable device that is easy to use, quick to set up and small enough to put in a bag or backpack.

It was packaged well, and there was no way the corners could have been damaged like this in shipping. About the letters: the gold ones are a bit browner than I expected. It\u2019s fine, but I was expecting them to be more cheery. You do have to cut the words out which was a bit confusing to me as all the regular letters came precut. It\u2019s fine. I was happy to only have to cut out a few things. It was just odd. Another odd thing is that it came with one drawstring bag for the letters. There\u2019s no way all of them would fit in that one bag and stay separated, so it\u2019s confusing as to why they bothered to include one at all if they weren\u2019t going to provide enough for each separate color/type. One last thing: It fits a bit too snug in the stand, and it almost seems like I\u2019m scratching it when I put it in there. It fits the best on the two sides that the lines are going vertically on (so the words would be sideways when I put it in there like that) which is not what we\u2019re going for.

I bought this to try out the pencils. I love working with watercolor pans and tubes. The paper and brushes are decent and work great for general art supplies. I would say they are good for beginners. The pencils were not my cup of tea. I have tried using them multiple ways and am not happy with them due to using pans the most. I do like the range of colors although, I had to re organize the trays. They didnt come in a layout that was sensible. I found that I like to use the pencils to outline my pieces that I dont want any regular pencil marks to show. The packaging of the pencils is also pretty lame. The trays inside are really flimsy and you have to be careful removing them or pencils will go a popping out. This is very annoying. I am probably gonna just bundle them in colors.", "review_title": "Like the supplies except the pencils", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}

Rather than pay shipping on the black cartridges, I bought them at the local Walmart for the same price as through Amazon -- no shipping charges. The interesting thing was that when the color cartridges arrived, they had been shipped by Office Depot -- no shipping charges on them.

So, skinny, but within the mainstream when it comes to body size. And this chair is terrible. I'll start with the worst part: the lumbar support. I have to wonder if the reviewers who spoke positively about spent any time sitting in the chair. It's hard and not near tapered enough, meaning it basically stabs me in the back as I sit. There's no way to disable the lumbar support -- even if I retract it all the way, it still pokes me. The adjustable height lets me choose exactly where I'll hurt later, but there's no comfortable spot and no way to remove the support altogether. The armrests are another problem. The ergonomic recommendations are to have the armrests support your elbows when they're loose at your sides. For me, the armrests don't go low enough -- that is, even the lowest armrest position still forces me to hunch my shoulders. While I paid for the 3D armrests, that was a waste of money. If I try to tilt them inward to comfortably use a keyboard, it makes the back of the armrests so far apart that my elbows can no longer hit them. Perhaps this chair is really great for someone much larger than I am.
