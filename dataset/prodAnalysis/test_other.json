What I do not like about this is that the auto tensioning knob that you turn to control how tight you want your clamp to be will quickly tighten itself over time. After 10 clamps, all of a sudden it is too tough for me to tighten and have to loosen over and over again. One other thing I do not like is that it is difficult to operate this with one hand, and I have large hands. You will however get the hang of it and will be able to better operate with just one hand. This tool is not for someone with average to weak hand strength though. This can be tough to use for the average joe, and sometimes useless because you need a tight squeeze for this clamp to clamp down sufficiently. For example, my girl friend was helping me clamp the pocket jig (she has helped on a lot of projects), and she couldn't even close it with two hands. She's not weak either, she's built farms, foundations for buildings, bridges for creeks made of stone, put up drywall, dug thousands of large holes to replant trees, etc. Instead, if you think this is you, I would just use a quick clamp by Irwin or Dewalt, which is almost as efficient as this kreg clamp for pocket holes. Luckily, I work in a wood shop, so my hands have been through many torture tests, and are strong enough for this tool. Given the auto tension knob issues, I still really like using this clamp and is worth the price because of the increased efficiency in my production.", "review_title": "Some issues, difficult to clamp down for most people, but I still value it use", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

My air conditioning in my home is set at 74 degrees, I live in Virginia, it is humid here. My water was warm within 30 minutes. I am not a fan of drinking warm water in hot, humid weather. After adding the crushed ice to the product it was difficult make it fit in around the infuser. I managed to get the product half full with ice. Once I finished the drinking the (fruit) flavored water, I hand washed the product and put it in a box for donation. This product is not for me. I am looking for a product that can be fruit infused and keep the water cold without all the fruit floating around in the drinking container. Someone out there will design this product, eventually.

If you're having issues with it shutting off randomly and all the wires are intact, replace the 18650. After doing so its stayed on even after hitting potholes. Original review: I've used it for a few rides now and it's a nice taillight. I ride in a very remote place with few streetlights and cars have been able to see me and act accordingly. But I've come to learn the wiring is seriously faulty design. My battery connector was so lose that if I moved it slightly it would shut off. Not fun to learn at 1am 16 miles away from home. And even after tightening it up it still seems there is a faulty wire that with the right amount of force (like a pothole) can shut it down. It's shaken my confidence about how well it can perform but I just make sure to keep a screwdriver on my rides now incase it ever acts up. Definitely test it out before taking it on a long nights journey.

I have another backpack that I use for school, but I wanted another bag I could grab and already have my work clothes/shoes, deodorant, other headphones, etc. This bag has so many useful components and sections and everything has a pocket of it's own. Almost anything I want to put in here has a perfect fitting sleeve or pocket and I know exactly where everything is (Yoga 2 Pro fits literally perfectly in the theft-proof laptop section in the underside of the strap right behind your back). I bought this because I thought it looked cool (and it really does, I've gotten a lot of compliments for it,) but I really underestimated how many uses this is applicable for. I can use it for work, personal bag for flights/trips, and even for school. I already have 2 friends that want to get this same bag and if you are thinking about getting this, you should. It's well worth the $30 and the waterproof fabrics are very well made and the quality made me value this bag at a lot higher of a price than what I got it for. Another thing I love about the one strap design is that when you adjust it to fit you perfectly, it fits very well and I can even jog with it on because it frees up my arms and I can move them anywhere unlike a traditional 2 strap backpack. It also helps put more of the weight on your upper body/chest instead of your shoulders and I can wear it for a much longer period of time than my other bags without making my shoulders/neck sore. Overall, this backpack has really solid material and very well thought out design and is well worth the price. Best bag I've ever bought.", "review_title": "I love this backpack!

As a bonus I only managed to lose one of the washers! -The lock washers that are used to hold the thing together are the cut washer type which from an engineering standpoint literally do nothing once everything has been tightened. I supposed they could help in light of the next design flaw I will mention but in my case they didn't. It's truly astonishing that manufacturers have ever used these types of lock washers and completely insane that they continue to do so. -The rods that threads through each end and are responsible for tying all the individual tools together are about 1/4\" too short. This means that when you tighten it down you don't tighten against the rod, you tighten against all of the tools. The effect of this is that you can't really tighten them down an effective amount because the individual tools won't be able to swing out. They did put a small dab of blue threadlocker on it but it wasn't enough to prevent mine from falling apart. I suggest that anyone who buys this disassembles it and puts a healthy helping of blue or maybe even red threadlocker on the threads. Once applying a bunch of threadlocker it seems to stay together enough for infrequent use. If you are someone who only has this for emergencies then I consider it a worthwhile tool for your pack. If you are planning on using this frequently then I suggest looking elsewhere. I see a lot of complaints about rust but unfortunately that is the nature of things. Stainless would be too heavy (and softer), aluminum would be too soft, and titanium would be too expensive. I suppose there could be a better coating on it but in the end you just need to not let it sit around wet. Keeping it slightly oiled would also help.", "review_title": "Nice emergency toolset but design issues can lead to it falling apart", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

It seemed advertised for wrapping handlebars of bikes for nonslip coverage, etc. It said it was flexible, and it was, in one direction only. I bought it to wrap the handles of forearm crutches so that the handle would be nonslip. These crutch handles slant slightly downward, creating a tendency to slip. Your product only has adhesive down the center of the strip; each side of the strip has no adhesive whatsoever. The product also does not flex to wrap a bar working your way up or down the bar, but layers must be laid evenly one upon another. The adhesive is not strong; one hour after wrapping the bars with 2 layers, layer upon layer, I returned to find the rigidness of the tape pulled the adhesive loose so that on both crutches the adhesive tape was hanging in straight pieces as though never wrapped, dangling to one single contact point on the crutch handle.

So far charged to full once and have been using on and off for 3 nights for short term stuff.

The swivel has a stopper built in, which means that if you turn it too much it ends up turning your bike seat along with it. Unfortunately, that turning radius is fairly small, so the stopper makes it hard to do simple things, like a right turn on a sidewalk. On the plus side, it seems to be a comfortable enough ride and the gearing (fixed) seems to be enough so that my kid can pedal at a reasonable (slow) speed.

I was actually surprised at the versatility of this little knife. The edge geometry is designed well, and cuts with ease. It's held up to me carving, hacking limbs, cutting various food items, and otherwise just general pocket knife uses. It's an excellent fire starter, with it's spark throwing 90 degree spine. If you're a backpacker in need of a lightweight blade for food prep and kindling/fire work, it's pretty great. If you want less moving parts than a pocket knife has, it does that. If you want precise control, the ergonomic handle provides it. One critique I have is that the steel is fairly soft. This just means you have to sharpen it more often, but it hones up really well. I would like to try a longer blade, maybe a Mora companion, but this fits in a pocket so well you'll forget it's there. *UPDATE* I've had this thing for months now and the functionality remains. However, I did miss a detail about the grind on this knife. The secondary front bevel on top of the original scandi grind doesn't match on both sides. One is higher than the other. It's relatively cosmetic, but could be an issue if your knife's grind geometry is affected.", "review_title": "Sturdy, Handy Pocket Fixed Blade", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

Acting is very good though...but the sameness gets redundant and a bit boring. Some of the same lines are used, throughout the movies. I was born shortly after these movies were filmed, and I recall much of what appears in them...the building styles, furniture styles to some extent, and some of the clothing styles were still popular in the 1950's. ..I was a very young girl but I recall a lot of this.

After reading all the reviews that these pants run a little large - I decided to stick with my size as a 10 because I wanted something that was a little more loose fitting and forgiving. I am glad I didn't order a size smaller because both pair I received did NOT run small. As a matter of fact - if I were to order again, I would size UP 1 size in order to have a little more room. The size 10 fit, but are a little tight everywhere except the waist. And as far as the length goes - I ordered the regular instead of the long, again because of reviews. They are BARELY long enough. The fit is more of a flare leg, not a straight leg. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if they were longer, but coming at mid-ankle and being flared just looks all kinds of wrong. I may just have to send these back and order the long size and have them altered. I wish there was a choice in between a 32\" inseam and a 36\" inseam. The fit is mid to low rise and comes about 2\" below my belly button. The zip pocket in the front fits my Galaxy 7 phone, but since the legs are tight I wouldn't put my phone here as it would be uncomfortable, look bulgy, and would somewhat restrict movement. I agree with others that the drawstring is fairly useless, and I also agree that it might be a good idea to double stitch the buttons once you get the pants. These are made in China and the manufacturing quality is probably not in line with the price point of these pants. They did however include an extra button stitched to the inside tag of the pants in case you lose one. At this point - 3 stars is the best I could offer these pants.

It's a big bottle, so of course it's much heavier than a plastic bottle. A hidden benefit is the handle on the back: it allows you to lay the bottle on its side without rolling around.

Until you get used to that, set it down slowly. - It's thin, contributing to its weight, obviously, but it also makes the cup prone to potentially being bent and misshapen if kept in a bag for travel or merely squeezing it a little too hard (though I don't imagine anyone will be doing that when filled with freshly poured coffee). - In terms of palming your mug, if you typically do that, remember this is a thin, steel cup, so you'll feel the heat on freshly poured coffee. Not a problem if holding by the handle. - The handle (take a look at the photo provided) is very ergonomic and practical. Nothing too fancy about it, but its shape provides easy transfer of movement from table to mouth. - If you're used to ceramic, you will smell and taste the steel. I don't notice TOO much of a difference when actually sipping coffee, but it will be noticeable. If you don't want any other flavors and scents mingling into your coffee drinking experience, stick with ceramic. - This being steel, heat will dissipate much more quickly. This isn't exact but, perhaps twice as quickly as in ceramic. Those are the highlights. The cup is very simple. It serves a very simple purpose and there's no bells and whistles about it at all. It's easy to clean and (if you think this to be a benefit) DOES cool your freshly brewed coffee down noticeably quicker than a ceramic mug would. It's best used for campfire coffees and quick drinks. I would still recommend ceramic over steel if your focus is on the coffee and the experience of drinking coffee (a slower experience). If you're focus is on getting coffee into your body so that you can do other things (a faster experience), this steel mug wouldn't be a bad investment.", "review_title": "Cools coffee faster than ceramic.", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

This product appears able to clamp onto any tubular structure on the bicycle, which would allow you to put a bottle holder wherever you want it. However, it lacks a swivel element between the clamp and the cage, which would allow you to rotate the cage to keep it vertical (so the bottle doesn't fall out!). Since there is no way to rotate the cage, don't bother trying to clamp it onto your handlebar or your top tube, because the cage will be horizontal and the bottle (or speaker) will fall out. Pretty much your only choice is to clamp it to a tube that's close to vertical, like the seat tube or the down tube. Also, the thumb-latch on the quick-release clamp only tightens or loosens the clamp by a few millimeters, so it's not really a quick-release at all: you still have to rotate the latch 10 or 15 turns to loosen it enough to pull the clamp off of the tube it's attached to, or to tighten it enough so it stays in place (and please don't apply too much pressure when tightening it, because the plastic latch is of such poor quality material that it will very easily snap in two!)", "review_title": "Poorly designed; built with low-quality materials", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

I don\u2019t like putting my baby on it because she ends up with blue particles all over her face that end up in her eyes and mouth. This should be able to withstand washing and use by two adults, a yorkie, and an infant.

It wouldn't be so bad if the remote had a keypad that I could enter the channel I want to go to but it does not. The only way to quickly navigate is by voice, scrolling is incredibly cumbersome. . Since neither of the 2 remotes I received has working voice control I have to use the Roku remote app on my phone. Voice control on the phone app works most the time on the IOS app. The other functions of the remote are also cumbersome and not intuitive. The remote control is the only interface with your TV and it is incredibly important. The TLC Roku TV has a cumbersome interface and a terrible remote control.

I was a bit puzzled as to why they made a dark pink and a light pink one - personally. I would have preferred subbing out the light pink set for a purple or red. The colors and sparkle show up well enough on black and white paper with one layer, but on dark paper look much better with at least 2 layers (be careful though because multiple pass-throughs will start soaking through the papers and I noticed particularly with the light pink marker that it picked up black paper fibers). Overall, these are fun markers and I will enjoy having them in my collection, but if you are looking for the best sparkle pens, my first recommendation is the Uniball Signo brand. I also have the Sakura Gelly sparkles, and I would consider those second - they both have way more colors and don't soak through the paper.

I have used a variety of poles and acquired these because of the compactness and portability to be able to keep a set in my truck. There are things I really like about these poles. Foremost, I like how well these pack down. Just spin the pole at the joint to loosen and condense it. It comes with clips to hold the poles together when collapsed. They are light weight and fit nicely in the storage bag which is a big plus. The variety of ends is perfect and the shock absorbing versus stability is very good. There are a couple of reasons why I didn't give these poles 5 stars. Number one, the handles. This is a big deal for me to get a good feel. Although I really like the molded grip, it is just a bit small for my larger hands. However, it's not a loss since they fit my wife's smaller hands reasonably well. Perhaps these should be offered with different handle sizes. Additionally, I am a fan of the cork handles. This is a preference and not necessarily a negative. Your choice may vary. I do like the stability grips below the handle when on uneven ground where you can adjust your grip in varying conditions. That portion is a foam composition and a nice feature. The second reason I could not give 5 stars is because although the storage bag is a great plus for these poles, there is no accommodation for storing the extra tips. A pocket on the outside of the bag would have easily satisfied this oversight. I don't want to have to store my tips separately away from the poles. Overall these poles are a great acquisition and am looking forward to using them on our trip to Glacier NP later this month.", "review_title": "Excellent packability", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

When you put it on in a breeze, you'll be reminded of those adverts for shampoo with the wind lifting up the model's long wavy hair and floating it about. Quite amusing at first and very cooling, but that entertainment wears off quickly when faced with the risk inherent in the hat's design. The bill/brim could be a shade longer but the biggest issue is that the flaps are too far forward. I've had to pin them back with safety pins so that my peripheral vision isn't suddenly blocked. Pinning them back has also helped cut down on the noise the flaps make as they flap about in even the lightest breeze, but the fact remains that without the safety pins, a flap can cross much of my face in an instant, momentarily totally blocking an eye on that side, blinding me to whatever might be coming from that side, which could be an accident waiting to happen. Even with no wind, without the pins in place, leaning forward to un-clip a weed-eater/brush cutter's harness, the flap kept blocking my view and after three attempts I had to take the hat off to do that simple task. I reckon the un-pinned flaps would be a hazard while driving, for example, a ride-on lawnmower. Curiously, despite being 100% nylon, they don't stink, or even whiff slightly, not even after a whole weeks wear. With a couple of safety pins handy, I'd quite happily recommend this product.", "review_title": "Safety pins required to avoid accidents", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

(Nothing address labels can't fix) *Ink streaks when filling in decent sized areas unless you do multiple layers (this doesn't bother me, I tend to use it as an advantage in my art work, but it is something to consider.) *The markers bleed!!! These bleed sometimes even while drawing over dry ink as well as using it on card stock or other thick paper (This again is not something that bothers me, but it's best to keep in mind if using on dual sided coloring books and what not.)

Also, love having, not one but 2, removable flashlights connected to the lantern. This is where I have an issue. We've had them fall out a few times, sometimes finding them on the ground the next day, but so far, we've always found them. There is a flip \"bar\" (for lack of better words) that is attached to the lantern that flips over the top of the flashlight so as to secure it on. It can flip up rather easily even when we take the time to make sure we are inserting the flashlights down and in and then the flip at the top. Great concept, would be so handy but it takes time to monkey with it to make sure that it's all together every time we move around with it. I suppose I could put a rubber band around it. Other than that it is a very decent light. Even with the occasional \"fall out\" I like this lantern better than one we have that cost near 2x as much.", "review_title": "Favorite lantern but have keep track of the \"attached\" flashlights", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

I used an electric pump so much quicker. It definitely will take a little longer with the manual pump that comes with it but should still be reasonable. The only issue Ive noticed is the the bottom portion tends to lose air. I noticed on both trips after coming out of the water, the bottom had deflated just slightly. So I would recommend taking the manual pump with you for longer trips in the water just to be safe. This is the only reason I\u2019m giving just 4 stars. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this kayak.

I read a lot of reviews here before I bought it, and came back and read more trying to figure out what my next move would be. One reviewer mentioned an extension, and I found one here at Amazon designed just for this purpose -- to use a bike rack. It's annoying a product made for an RV doesn't not state it is designed to work on only a trailer or class C camper. Another issue is we will not be able to use either our furnace or generator while it's inserted in the receiver. In my photo you can see the receiver under the body of the coach. The two vents in the center are for the gas furnace and the tiny pipe in the lower left of the picture is the generator exhaust pipe.

Normally their products are well made and constructed. Unfortunately this pad appears to be an afterthought. The straps (as many have mentioned) are attached in a very flimsy manner, and in fact are attached such that they can\u2019t help but separate. A linear pull on the straps or mat delaminates them because they are stitched backwards to the direction of force. An obvious design flaw. Furthermore, the mat lacks any heft at all to hold it down on the angled surface of the vehicle...it\u2019s so light the force of gravity does not even overcome the memory curve you get if you keep it rolled up. Funny though - if you look at the product picture you can see the upward curve of the mat lol. Save yourself some money and go to Kmart, buy TWO bath mats with rubber backings and drape one over your vehicle, and place the other under the back end of your kayak to prevent scrapes as you angle it up onto your racks. You will pay 1/2 of the 40 bucks you would be shelling out for this mat and can use them to throw all of your wet gear on in the back of your vehicle when you\u2019re done.

Most zipper pulls have a hole so you can hook key chains or LOCKS to your zippers if you wanted. This pack does not have that, the zipper pulls are completely solid.

We did not put the wheels on as this is for storage in the kitchen so it won't be moved around much. Do NOT ignore the instruction that two people are required. It is absolutely imperative that you have two people to assemble- one to hold the pieces snug together, and one to screw/nail the pieces together. It took my husband and I about 4 hours to put this together. The nails included don't work too well (very tiny, being a bit sharper would have helped), we had to hammer unbelievably hard to get the nails to go into the wood to attach the back to the unit and the bottoms to the drawers. There are a few places where the screw holes in one piece did not line up with the edge of the connected piece, which resulted in the screw cracking the wood and coming through the wood. We will need to cover these spots with tape so we don't cut ourselves on the screws when digging around in the drawers- this is why one star was taken off: poor planning on screw hole locations. I was tempted to rate it only 3 stars due to how difficult it was to put together, but it seems sturdy, and it's also real wood instead of particle board. It seems like it will last awhile. I guess ultimately I would rate it 3.5 stars if I could rate halfs.", "review_title": "Sturdy unit- difficult and time-consuming to assemble.", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

And the battery does NOT last to 5 hours, even with a full charge! We've been getting maybe a little over an hour of play with it but so far it has not played a single full movie so I think we might have gotten a bad battery. The game controller works very well and is easy enough to use for a toddler so happy with that. The sound is great, as well as the video playback. Overall, it's okay but it definitely needs a slight upgrade to the mini disk slot and a second check on battery life before shipment.", "review_title": "It's okay but has a few flaws.", "language": "en", "product_category": "other"}

Ok, so let's talk about what came in the box. It includes a nice remote, the A/V cables, power cord, and a bonus HDMI cable! The packaging is really high quality and projector looks and feels so as well. Setup was super easy, about 2mins and I had YouTube projected on my wall. I have to say the picture quality was way better than I expected! I don't even currently have a screen, so I was projecting it on my bare wall that's not even white. I will say, it does help to have it as dark as possible when watching. If there is a negative, it's that it's not crazy bright, but I didn't expect that for a sub $200 HD projector. With that said, I think it's just fine in most cases. I imagine with a proper screen, or even a flat white wall, it would look dang good.

The legs stretch out the longer you wear them, then tighten up again after the wash.
