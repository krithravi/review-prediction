This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn\u2019t working properly. I know this laptop has tons of good ratings, and I bought it because of that, but I would stay away from this model if you want a laptop that will last you two years or more.", "review_title": "Good laptop, terrible case breaks after less than 2 years", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

The drive stopped working in March. I contacted Samsung and went through the process to have it sent in for inspection. The process was slow because my maintenance request was not initially approved. Once it was approved I had to package and send it with a prepaid UPS label that was sent to me. The device was defective and I was sent a replacement SSD. The replacement came as a refurbished SSD. I called Samsung and was told there was an error on my paperwork that put the date of manufacture versus date of purchase. Samsung warranty is a refurbished product 90 days after purchase. I was told to send back the refurbished one so they could send a new SSD. The process took a couple of weeks. I received my new SSD and in May it too failed. I again called Samsung and went through the process. The drive was defective and I was sent a refurbished SSD again. I called Samasung, again. I was told this time it was over 90 days since purchase and a refurbished exchange is their warranty. So I basically only had each new SSD for less than 2 months before they failed. I would not recommend this product to anyone.", "review_title": "Don't buy this, go with a competitor SSD", "language": "en", "product_category": "pc"}

Also to note, this only seemed to be a problem on my windows computer. When I tried writing the board from Arduino IDE on Linux, simply putting the board into write mode seemed to work as expected. (I have no idea why) One more note, I could not get these boards to be recognized USB devices on Mac at all. Apparently there is a known driver signing issue between the driver for these, and Mac's running OS X 10.13 or higher, that to-date, has yet to be fixed.

But the performance is a little lacking and communicating with the extender isn't flexible. In terms of performance, I'm standing next to the extender and I'm getting 48% uplink speed at 2.4Ghz and 96% at 5Ghz. I bought this mainly for 2.4Ghz use. The signal strength is much lower, 58% at 2.4Ghz and 30% at 5Ghz. Initial Android setup was easy but it doesn't have the option to rename or hide the SSID. If the SSID name is the same as the source SSID, it adds EXT to the name, which I don't like. I'd prefer the name the same as the source SSID so it is as close to mesh extenders as possible. If I'm using my phone, I simply disconnect and reconnect. It picks the SSID (source or extender) with the stronger signal. If the names are different, I have to consciously pick the SSID with the best signal. In order to fix those issues, I have to use a desktop browser via Ethernet. The only way to communicate to the extender wirelessly from the desktop browser is to press the reset button on the extender. But this erases the prior settings.

There are a lot of updates and tweaking to the actual system you seem to have to do in order to get it running smoothly and proficiently. I didn't find all of that necessary. It also seems to have glitches which I haven't quite figured out with the screen blacking out for extended times during updates. I also do not care for the fact that it doesn't have an internal CD/DVD RW drive. You would have to have one externally for this particular laptop. It does seem to carry a good amount of memory however which is a plus. It also has just the right amount of ports that you need and is bluetooth enabled so you are good to go there. The graphics on it are pretty decent. However, again with the extensions. The sound really isn't that great on the actual device, but it is great when added device for sound is applied.

I bought this one because it was apparently light, compact, and well functioning (and favorably reviewed). It does work well and is indeed easy to use. However, several things -- some of which I knew in advance -- are being a drag, now that I have been using it for a couple of months. First, the screen is quite small (which I should have know), which makes text hard to read. It's OK to watch video, but difficult for tasks that require actual reading. Second; it is powered through an external AC source, which forces you to carry a power adapter when you travel, be near a power outlet when you work, and have an extra cable around your machine when you use it (see picture). Third, it does not have a built in stand. Instead, it comes shipped with a detached stand, which is an extra thing to carry around (without losing) when you travel.

But this time I decided to go the other route after doing my researching and finding out the ludicrous costs of keyboards from brands like razer and corsair. I was hesitant at first because this product is obviously from china and from a not so known brand. But after looking at the high reviews from other customers, I decided to take the plunge. I went with the stainless steel, blue-back lit option. So far after a year of use, I'm happy to report that this product is worth the cost. For only $40 you get a well made product with good (but unnecessary) features. The clicks are very tactile and is a joy to use. They are extra loud which some of you might prefer. But be aware that the loud noise might be an annoyance to others. I had to use my laptop keyboard in my room at night to not awake my roommate. Tha back lit feature is welcome but after using it for the first month, I leave it off.

This device has everything I need and the AV for computers and phones is really nice and easy to use. The major thing that could be improved is the parental control and reporting interface. Its a mix of on device application, and cloud based application. As soon as I figured that out (not well documented) I was able to get pretty much what I wanted out of it. Due to that the interface is a bit clunky and not the smoothest to figure out or manage, but definitely not the worst I have ever worked with.

The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked.

The case is a nice quality and the color is a pleasant blue. The construction is solid and overall it seems to be well made. I\u2019m coming from the trifold style of cover and this cover has a different set up. It leaves a larger footprint on your work surface because of the way it is propped up on the flat inside front of the cover. This will just take some getting used to and isn\u2019t necessarily bad. The other issue I have is with the way the hard shell internal case is only attached to the spinning mechanism on one side. It is necessary so that the iPad can rotate, but this makes the larger iPad Pro feel a little unsafe because without paying attention it flops open when folding the cover back to hold in the hands as opposed to propping. The iPad seems securely attached to the hard shell but it is awkward. I\u2019m thinking that perhaps adding a magnet to the back of the hard shell case on the left edge of the vertically oriented iPad so it would delicately attach and be easy to pull off for propping and rotating would easily remedy this. In fact, I\u2019ll probably go buy a sticky magnet and try that.

Yes I understand they are suppose to handle up to 20 meters, but if they cannot handle 7 feet away to my bed from my PC they are worthless. I spoke to Kingston Tech Support and they felt it was interruption from my wireless network router. They told me to power cycle it and to move it to another room to fix the issue.

If you don't move far from your PC when using them, then they might be perfect for you. PROS: they are comfortable to wear, closed back to isolate from other noises to help you pinpoint opponents, great sound, long battery life, wireless (when they work).

Could not return after reading that Western Digital (non-enterprise edition) disks do not support RAID in ICY Dock manual. In my case I wanted to provide a reliable and small backup drive to operate in RAID 1 mode to store all of my precious personal files and photos. The problem with RAID is that if the enclosure controller fails in a low cost system you will probably not be able to get an exact replacement and both of your redundant RAID 1 copies will need to be wiped. Also, the enclosure latches really are not secure and the fan is noisy even when set to lower speeds. Overall, I would suggest consumers buy 2 backup drives with adequate capacity for their application. Run automatic backup and do a manual backup every 3 or 6 months on the second drive. This drive should be stored in a remote location from the main backup drive in case of fire, flood or other disaster.

My primary requirement was 5.1 encoding via optical out, as that's what my speaker system uses (and what my X-Fi did without issue). After taking about 15 minutes to even find the 5.1 encoding options (they're hidden in the very poorly labelled \"cinematic\" section of the control panel), I was able to set both Dolby Digital Live and DTS and both work, at least initially. But over time I began to hear little pops and hiccups in the sound until the encoding would just fail and the sound would go silent, requiring me to go back to the control panel, turn the encoding off, and then back on again. This is now the standard pattern: set the encoding, it'll work for a while (usually an hour or two, sometimes less), then the audio will start to glitch a bit, until the fails, and the process has to be repeated. On top of all this, immediately after installing the card and updating the drivers from the Creative Labs web site (because the auto updater failed), every time I open the control panel or even switch audio devices (e.g. when using Bluetooth headphones) at least half a dozen \"bad image\" errors pop up complaining about a particular DLL. This doesn't seem to have any effect on any functionality but requires clicking to dismiss these alerts over and over again (and they are always on top so they cannot be ignored). I've tried reinstalling the drivers, disabling other devices, running driver cleaners, nothing has helped.
