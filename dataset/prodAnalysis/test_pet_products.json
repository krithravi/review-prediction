We live in the woods and brush/trees often conceal his whereabouts. This solves that issue, plus a full fence will be going up on our property soon! Although as you can see by the pic he is less than thrilled with wearing it (won't look at me!) I am relieved to have something to make him more visible when we are hiking and also on our property/extra visibility if he does escape towards the road again. It's probably my computer monitor that makes the listing pic look like the vest is simply a yellow orange...it is much more vivid in real life. This thing is BRIGHT. It is true hunter's *neon* orange, and as you can see from the pics attached, the reflective straps are VERY reflective (that's just my cell camera flash in a lighted room). If you are looking for a fashion accessory for your pooch, this is something out of a hunting catalogue not Doggie Vogue but visibility is exactly what I was after. Our dog is about 60 lbs, Border Collie/Springer Spaniel mix, a little on the barrel-chested side...he measures about 33\" circumference at the widest spot on his rib cage and a size L fits him perfectly with plenty of room to adjust the straps. I could easily cut the excess strap off but there is about 4\" extra around his neck and about 3\" extra strap at his waist. So far it appears very well made yet the fabric is nice and light...and as someone whose dog goes nuts listening to crinkly fabric, I can say that this is not crinkly or loud at all. In fact he is now fast asleep wearing it indoors. I'll update the review with wear and tear feedback once we've had it for a few weeks.", "review_title": "Great buy, good quality, accurate fit", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

She had destroyed all of the cages we purchased. We even put the hard plastic crate inside the wire crate and she got out within hours. This was my last hope. I read all of the reviews before I purchased this crate because of the price; I have seen what she can do no matter what the manufacturer says. We have had it almost a week and so far so good. She still tries all of her antics that she used with the other crates but to no avail! She has scratched off some of the paint but there are no dints and no bends. When the wheels are locked she can't move the crate. (My 5 year old has even hooked his skateboard to it like a bungee cord and it doesn't move LOL) This one has finally tamed the beast.

It\u2019s about on average with every other dog bed that goes flat after a year. When we opened it it looked like a cloud and my arthritic lab had trouble climbing into bed bc it was SO. fluffy. But once it flattened after a few days he slept so hard I could barely get him up in the morning, which he loves getting up in the morning so I knew he was VERY comfortable. He still loves it but I ended up buying a twin sized egg shell crate foam bed topper to go under it because it\u2019s getting too flat. Cut it to size and it works great. As for durability/waterproofing: a few weeks after I got it my other dog decided she wanted the most comfortable spot to have her puppies. After she was done I completely sprayed down/sanitized the bed and found that one side is not water proofed at all and the other just has a very thin plasticky layer that hardly can be called waterproofing. After the puppies incident and considering my old dog has accidents, I ended up putting a twin sized waterproof mattress cover on it. Overall it\u2019s a good bed just for the size of it. It\u2019s MASSIVE! I can lay on it with my two large dogs and we can all lay comfortably. Just be aware it\u2019s not water proof/resistant if that\u2019s what you need and it will go flat after about a year if used regularly. And if you don\u2019t want to struggle with washing the cover regularly buy a twin fitted sheet to put over it.

Despite the mix reviews I decided to order this for my 29 gallon freshwater tank I\u2019ve been working on. I really liked how the castle looked with the small cave and the dementions were perfect for what I needed (about the size of a soda can). After reading some of the negetive reviews before ordering I decided when I received the castle I would soak it in water for a few days to see what would happen. Guys it\u2019s been soaking in a clean cup for 4 days and already there is a chemical smell coming from the water. I don\u2019t doubt the resin used to mold this is safe. However, this paint they are using on the castle is definitely dissolving into the water. Not only that I don\u2019t think the paint is eco safe either, it smells....wrong. I think I\u2019m going to continue soaking this for up to a week alternating between sanitizer and clean water. After that I might coat the castle with some acrylic gloss protective spray paint a few times to hopefully seal it off before placing it in my tank. Besides the failure with the paint I love how this thing looks.

This new style harness is as easy to get onto him as dropping the harness over his head and clipping one strap under his chest. Here are my personal observations: Pros: + Easy Peasy to put onto my pooch. + No loops for his front legs. + Comfortable and wide main harness material. + Moderately adjustable for chest size. Cons: - No adjustment for front chest strap - it is a fixed size based on the size you order which is the reason for my reduction by one star. Neutral: = I hope you like the color purple - because there are two large purple product tags sewn onto the sides of the main harness piece regardless of what color harness you get. = Measure your pooch carefully - you may be able to use a harness that is too big but your dog will be able to get out of it easier than one that is properly sized.

My husband had to run the cord through PVC pipe and mount it to the backside of cage otherwise, my bird would have pulled that cord in and chewed it up..I highly recommend using PVC pipe for this.. so within a few hrs if being installed, I felt it and it was hot to touch. .once again like the perch I bought from this company..since it's a side mount, I will keep it but it is too hot...luckily my bird can get away from it or get close as much or as little as he wants.. I am disappointed In the thermostats of these newer versions...I had two perches from 10 yrs ago by this company and they both got luke warm and remained perfect for yrs...don't know what the company changed, but they need to go back to old style.. people please check and check again with any heater from this company....for your birds safety..", "review_title": "MAKE SURE YOU KEEP CHECKING HEAT BY YOUR OWN HAND.

Otherwise the tank is well made. The instructions could be a little better written as well. Since I have a beta I kept it because technically they are okay without a filter but having a working pump without such a strong pull in a small tank would definitely be a plus for the fish. Will continue to work on this, if it works later I will come back and rewrite my review to reflect it.", "review_title": "Hard to regulate the pump flow", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

Our puppy, Peanut, likes to run into the underbrush sniffing out whatever critter has been roaming our property. The coat got caught on a branch and fell off in the brush. After finally finding it and looking it over well, we discovered the velcro-type closings had accumulated a lot of dog hair and just were not effective enough anymore to keep the coat on. Dog hair is bound to get caught in the fibers of the velcro-style closures! I came up with a fix: sewed on twill tape and parachute-type buckles - one on the neck and one on the underbelly and we have not experienced another issue.

Mine is a 3 month old standard poodle and she went nuts for this bone at first. Even after the yummy outer layer of dried meat bits and inner marrow was gone, she is still going back to it and not going after the furniture (admittedly I have gotten her a variety of chew toys, so it isn\u2019t just because of the bone). No sign of splintering or becoming dangerous. For $4 a bone the price is right even if I replace the bone every week. My dog is right under 20 lbs for size reference, and she isn\u2019t an aggressive chewer- only one soft toy partially destroyed in the month of having her. My puppy eats grains free without artificial coloring or flavor food and this hasn\u2019t given her any diarrhea or gas. No bad breath and I haven\u2019t noticed any smell really coming from the bone unless I bring it close to my face.

After over a month of trying to get Amazon and/or the company to respond, the company finally responded and send a replacement pump. This one crapped out in 36 hours. Amazon is so big now that they don't know when they're selling knock offs and lemons. The ratio of good products to lemons is shifting in favor of lemons. Old review: This is a great product when it works, BUT: We purchased this item a little over one month ago. We set it up and began using it about three days after it arrived. Within the month of purchasing it, it has broken in different ways six times. The first 5, my husband was able to repair it himself. However, the sixth time, the necessary repairs are beyond the scope of our ability. So I checked on Amazon how we could exchange it for a model that WORKS. Sadly, we missed the window for which Amazon is willing to replace the defective product by about 10 days. This is extremely frustrating -- almost as if it's built only to last during the warranty period, after which it irreparably breaks and there is no possibility of exchanging it for a model that works. We invested plenty of our own time and energy repairing it ourselves, so we believe we have been plenty generous in terms of holding up our end of the bargain. Now it is entirely useless and we can't return or exchange it. To put it another way: THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP-OFF. THE BUYER PAYS FOR A LEMON, AND IN RETURN, AMAZON SAYS \"TOO BAD, NOT OUR PROBLEM\" WHEN THE PRODUCT FAILS. THE BUYER IS OUT $$$ BUT AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME AMAZON HAS RIPPED US OFF (THE OTHER WAS A PAIR OF WIRELESS EARBUDS PURCHASED DURING THE AMAZON PRIME DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST THAT NEVER WORKED AT ALL -- AND NOT JUST US -- BUT SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT AMAZON ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN THE REVIEW SECTION MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WARN OTHER BUYERS OF THE SCAM) We have been good customers of Amazon from the beginning. However, the customer service is getting worse and worse every day. Now that Amazon and Bezos have more money than several small countries, not to mention the VAST number of consumers who have placed our trust in Amazon, purchased probably THOUSANDS of their products, and contributed greatly to the company's wealth (which, according to their hardworking employees, does NOT trickle down by investing in the employees who actually do the hard work). Compare this to a friend of mine who bought a Fitbit many months ago and decided she didn't like the design and Amazon didn't make her jump through hoops or pay shipping/return charges, they simply sent her a brand new one in a style she liked. That Fitbit cost about 5x more than the two products I've tried to return, but our customer service experiences are vastly different. Part of Amazon's game is to make returning a defective product such a hassle that the customer ultimately gives up and buys a new product, eating the financial loss. AMAZON. DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. ANY. MORE. So what am I paying the \"Prime\" membership for? Being a Prime customer is getting more expensive, yet the \"services\" covered under #Prime are eroding to the point that there's virtually no benefit to being a Prime customer. Yes, I've talked more about Amazon's business practices than the lemon product I should be reviewing here. But how can I review a product that has spent more time not working than working? And if Amazon doesn't have my back when I'm spending tons of money on this site? Who has MY back?

But, the most awesome thing about purchasing this e-collar is the incredible customer support I received when I called them to inquire about replacing the remote, which I lost! They sent me a new remote at no extra charge! Amazing! I would highly recommend this system and a friend had already purchased one at my suggestion for his Lab.
