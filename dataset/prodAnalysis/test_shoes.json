Things to consider before buying: First off they run large. Secondly they are very vented. The entire tops of these shoe is a mesh type of material that breaths very well. No soo good when dealing with winter weather though. I love the slip on aspect of the shoe due to the nature of my work. However that backs of the shoe likes to bunch up when putting them on and it's not exactly easy to fix once your foot is in the shoe. You have to take measures to prevent that as your foot slides into the show. This is the reason behind my low rating of these shoes: First off the tread collects everything due to the small gaps in the tread. If you are out in the rain, snow, or mud you will carry that stuff on the bottom of your shoe for a very long time once you come in doors. Water doesn't even clean out very well. So tracking even water becomes an issue. These are also worthless in the snow or ice. Very slick and absolutely no traction. I fell at work due to this problem. Wet floors is even a problem. My biggest issue with these shoes is a manufacturer defect. There is some sort of seam right next to my big toe witch that had caused me to stop wearing the shoes. It hurts and causes me to walk in a way to try and avoid it. This causes a tremendous amount of pain in my feed by the end of the day. I could get passed all the other flaws, however this flaw makes these shoes completely useless.", "review_title": "I stopped wearing them due to a manufacturer defect.", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}

They actually look good in the pictures and in person, however, they feel cheaper than a pair of $10 backup glasses I got from Walmart. And these Oakleys are even more uncomfortable then the Walmart glasses. They are constructed of plastic and the nose area is wide and flat with no cushioning. Although these glasses feel light in your hand, they do have some heft weighing down on your nose. So it was uncomfortable from the moment I put them on. Cant imagine how they would feel after an hour of wearing. The matte version of these are coated in some sort of powdered rubber material which looks nice, but any products I ever known with this material always breaks down and starts chipping off. Probably even quicker when exposed to sun, heat, sweat...etc. One thing I do like about these glasses in comparison to other Oakleys (or many other glasses in general) are they fold up much flatter than most. They did not come with a case though. Only a flimsy bag which wont protect much of anything. Not really sure whats going on with these big name sunglass companies these days....? I am in the market for new glasses because my expensive Under Armor glasses which I only owned for a couple years died a slow death from the day I bought them. I checked out a few other pairs of oakleys, and they seem better made. But nothing like what they used to be. Its a shame because these really look nice.

First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the \"peep,\" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label.

I also wasn't thrilled with how the shoes were packaged. They were squished together in a bag, instead of being kept in a box. Unfortunately, I'm returning them. They are cute though.

I didn\u2019t notice this until I had worn them for a few hours. :( I don\u2019t know if this is typical or just a fluke that got by Quality Control.

EDITED to add: I took these on vacation as my only pair of shoes and they were killing me! The short toe strap dug into my foot requiring a bandaid every day. Also, the edge of the strap on the top of my foot rubbed my foot raw. I have scarred/healed rubbed off skin area on my feet now. Yikes! Too bad because the footbed is incredibly comfortable and the style is cute. I have to change my four star review to 2 stars because I can\u2019t wear them and they gave me broken skin and scars.
