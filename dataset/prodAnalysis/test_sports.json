I bought for my wife to use with an inexpensive youth compound 25# bow. They work great, but required some setup: 1. The nocks are not glued in place, but are very tight in the shaft. You will need to align them for your bow setup. For me, this meant setting the index (white) fletching outward away from the arrow rest. You simply need to grasp the nock with a small pair of pliers, and grasp the arrow shaft near the nock and twist to the correct position. 2. The nocks were too loose on my bow's string. You can carefully soften the plastic over a candle flame and squeeze the tips together with pliers or your fingers (Be careful not to burn yourself.) If you get the plastic hot enough to burn yourself, it is hotter than it needs to be. But it is easy to get it too hot, ruin the nock, and burn yourself! Alternatively, you could replace the nocks with a smaller size and avoid the flames. I chose to play with fire and am very happy with the results. Please don't burn yourself, and if you are a minor, do this only with adult supervision. These arrows are light, well made, and fly very well with the 100 gr points and 3\" fletching. The screw-in points meet flush with the shafts, so these arrows will not catch on your target when you go to extract them. This is a very important upgrade over the really cheap target arrows with glued on field points! Plus you could potentially change points and use these for small game. Enjoy.", "review_title": "Great, economical target arrows.", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

I watched some reviews where people thought the blade had corrosion already on it out of the box. Is not corrosion just the treatment process. I tested the sharpness on some paper and found the main cutting edge to be not quite as sharp as the other two which are scary sharp. A few seconds on my ceramic sticks and leather strop and the main blade was equal to the others so no complaints there. The sheath seems to be decent quality and has excellent retention with no rattle so I\u2019m really happy about that. It kinda helps with the perception of quality however the giant mercenary tactical banner on the blade somewhat negates that if that makes any sense. As far as durability I really don\u2019t plan on abusing it to find out so I really can\u2019t comment. I honestly bought it because the reviews are good and I like the looks of it aside from the aforementioned logo. The knife Is definitely mini in size but fits my smaller hands well.

The button is mushy and gets stuck in the depressed position. I sprayed some liquid graphite in it and was able to get it to unlatch. However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place. If you are looking for QD swivels for a duty rifle or any gun you'd depend on with your life then look elsewhere, these will fail when you least expect them to.

There is absolutely NO leather in these gloves at all... they are spandex with some type of polymer composite palm grip.

The stitching of the grip side of the fingers is splitting in multiple places in only 2 months of use. As I said, I deliver mail with them, so I don't know how much stress these gloves would take if I was actually using them as batting gloves. I will say, though, that the polymer/composite grip is not particularly \"grippy\"... the steering wheel slides right through my hands.

My experience with the product itself is excellent and I regard it as one of the best options for shooting sticks out there.

Once I took it out I found that sand was literally packed into all of the mechanisms. Very hard to turn the top assembly and the legs did not drop freely when I pulled the trigger. I packaged back up and requested a replacement from Amazon. The second one came to me and although it still had the blister pack on top, the legs were all marked up and one was bent. No signs of sand in the mechanism of this one but overall condition was poor. I have requested another replacement from Amazon and will update this review once it is received. Again, my low rating of the product has to do with the condition I received it in, twice. I rarely have issues with ordering from Amazon and it has always been replaced right the first time.

It appears that the pressure switch went bad. I put the normal tail cap on and it goes on and off as normal, so definitely a remote switch issue. So I can't say I would recommend this light for shooting, overall it's a nice little light..bright enough...but I wouldn't buy another one to mount on a rifle and use a pressure switch for activation.

The lid cap and gasket tends to mold easily. Although you can take the gasket out to clean it, the lid has too many nooks and crannies that are too small to properly clean. Given how hard it is to clean, I don't think this bottle is worth the high price. I threw mine away and moved on to a more convenient bottle. The concept of this bottle is great, but the execution of the lid leaves much to be desired. Revised review: I originally gave this product a low rating (see original review below). The company reached out to me and was very helpful. Turns out you can use a dull object, like a fork, to pop the silicone gasket out, which then makes the gasket and the lid easier to clean. Thus, I revised my rating from 1 star to 5 stars. Original review: I've had this bottle for more than 6 months now. The lid has your standard silicone ring deep inside it. I stored Gatorade in the bottle and the lid ring molded. The cap is simply too small to clean - I tried using small toothbrushes and other small brushes, but nothing can clean the mold out. The design is nice, but it holds less liquid than advertised. Overall, not worth the steep price due to all the issues I've been having.", "review_title": "UPDATED AGAIN -- Lid molds and can't be cleaned, not worth the price", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED! At just about 2 lbs and a packable size to put inside a pack or bag...I can take this anywhere without the burden of bulky heavier chairs to lug around while I'm the Sherpa for all of the other sports/beach gear! This chair has super sturdy lightweight poles and backing much like something you might find at REI but for almost half the price! The extra bonus kicker is the ground mat that the legs go into if you're sitting in sand or snow. I recently did a trip to MT in July and camped in the snow...this chair would have solved the problem of the legs sinking into the snow causing a very unbalanced or near impossible sitting. I used this at the beach this last weekend while fishing and had zero issues of feet sinking into the sand and was very easy to set up. They included another great feature like pull tabs to help get the poles into the backing and ground mat. Great idea and a very comfortable chair!

Well, I can easily measure the 52 part, and that's clearly not right --- it's about 40 mm looking into the large lense. So I tend to believe the other reviews that say that you're not getting 16x magnification either. Still, so long as you understand the size and weight of the thing, I think it's good for the price. Size: just under 6\" long, outer diameter at widest point about 2\", case is roughly 6\" x 2-1/2\" wide by 2\" 'deep'. Weight: 8 oz even for the monocular, 8.7 oz in the included case. My big beef with this --- why I give it 3 stars rather than 4 --- is that the very first time I tried to use it was in kayaking. I put a strap from my life vest through the belt loop and as soon as I stood up it immediately fell to the ground. The stitching on the belt loop was that poor that it immediately failed as soon as the weight of the item was put on the stitching. So for quality control I'd give them a minus 5 stars. I really want a reliable attachment loop so will fiddle with a small needle to try to hand stitch it in place working sort of inside the item --- what a (needless) hassle. More to the point, I'm fortunate that it didn't fall off and into the water while I was kayaking. Don't rely on their belt loop, test it first.", "review_title": "Decent for the money, fairly large/heavy, belt loop stitching immediately failed", "language": "en", "product_category": "sports"}
