The instructions don't say anything about needing to \"sync\" the remote control with the car and I didn't figure this out till I brought the toy to someone else to see if they could figure out why it wouldn't work. The car drives easily and transforms from car to robot smoothly. My son absolutely loves it. It is very fragile and easy for a young kid to break (my son is 5 and on the first day broke the arm of the robot off accidently and I had to glue it back on). The charging system is similar to that of an RC car, meaning its fragile and the charge doesn't last very long. Definitely not able to be charged without an adult's help. Also, it speaks but is not very easy to understand at all. This toy had the potential to be very cool and despite my son loving it I find the toy quite lacking.", "review_title": "My son loves it but it could be better", "language": "en", "product_category": "toy"}

Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track.

However, it's been not barely past two months and suddenly I look over and see a LOT of stickers peeling and falling off (the kids don't touch this- it's high up). This is so frustrating. The only thing I can think of doing is finding some clear glue to press each and every little sticker back on- what a headache. I had to call each grandma up and warn them this might happen to theirs. I even helped press each sticker on tightly and accurately with my daughter so I know it's not because we didn't put it on right.

The mounting platform package does not include the screws that are needed to mount it to the Everest 10 frame....and the servo does not include a servo arm to connect to the stearing arm. So neither product can be used as they are shipped. I've purchased hundreds of RC servos over the past 30 years and this is the first one that has required me to make an additional purchase of a servo arm. While the parts appear to be of good quality, I will not be picking Redcat products as replacements in the future simply because Redcat has decided to not meet the RC industry standard of including the needed hardware to make the part functional.", "review_title": "So Frustrating!!!", "language": "en", "product_category": "toy"}

SPOILER ALERT: It actually does a full back flip, which both surprised us and impressed us. We were sad though when it broke at the end of 1st day. I'm not sure what our 34 month old did to break it, but the legs came off and tee inside winder was pushed in. Bummer because Frog was the coolest one so far.
