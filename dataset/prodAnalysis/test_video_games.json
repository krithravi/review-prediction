However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else.

I bought this game primarily to play the multiplayer with friends, but played through the campaign to get a feel for the game. Graphics are okay, no better than par for the course at this point (Battlefield's are slightly better). Frequent display glitches where the top 25% of the screen would lag or break pretty consistently during cutscenes. Story is unimpressive and the overly aggressive CO gets old extremely quick. Gameplay was choppy at best, seems there's a cutscene or a change of perspective every time you start to build any momentum. The health pack system made the play very frustrating - most levels are played something like: pop two shots, find cover, use health pack, repeat. Simply not very satisfying completing the campaign. Multiplayer is as bad as others have described. If you have someone else living with you who does not appreciate you yelling at the screen constantly, for their sake, do not buy this game. Laggy, inconsistent, and frustrating. As I mentioned earlier, I bought the game to play multiplayer with friends. The party system is an absolute mess. It's nearly impossible to play with friends. First, you have to change default settings to join parties at all, and if you're lucky enough to successfully create or join a party, you're likely to end up in entirely different games. I'd estimate I've successfully played the same match as my friends no more than 20% of the time.

There are plenty of reviews telling you the good stuff which I mostly agree with. So I'm going to list my gripes about this case first. They definitely could have given people who protect their Switch some leeway where the Switch rests. I prefer to keep a shell on my Switch whenever I'm not using the dock and silicone covers on the joycons at all times, and with both of those on it was a crazy snug fit, if the strap wasn't there to help pop it out I think I would have problems getting my switch out of there. So I keep my joycons in the pouch and just the screen on the bottom to make things fit better, plus its quicker to slide the screen into the self folding standing like that for me. On the opposite side of things, the accessory pouch on top actually has too much room in my opinion. Although this ranges depending on what accessories you're actually wanting to bring with you. The power adapter sits perfectly fine and stays put, however while I only have two joycons to test and not four or more, there's no real way to strap them in there, so they can easily shimmy around and possibly fall out somewhat easily. You can bring a generous amount of game carts with you, but the direction placement seems like a design oversight because the game carts hang downward, especially if you were actually carrying the case around by the handle. After one short walking trip I found half the game carts I had in there were halfway about the fall out. If they were flip it the other way then the games would hang while you had it in stand mode, but that's much better having the games jostled around and coming a bit loose if you were carrying it by the handle. I only have this case in mind for actual console and game transfer rather than toting it around, so this also isn't a huge deal. Other than those two gripes, this case is awesome. The fold out stand is wonderful to have. It rests on a soft material and it supports the Switch well. I use it more than the crappy plastic HORI stand I bought a long time ago. I do wonder if its wise to rely on it for long play sessions though, because the cutouts for the vents in the back could be bigger, and I'm not sure if having a protective case on it like in my pictures might cause unnecessary overheating, but its still a great option to have and a standout feature. As far as actual protecting your switch goes? I'm confident an honest accidental drop on the ground will keep your Switch nice and safe, even if the case landed on concrete. Water proof? I honestly don't suggest you keep this by the swimming pool or bathtub and hoping it protects from an accidental submerge, but if someone unluckily spilled something on the case, I believe everything inside will be protected just fine. I may have sounded harsh on this product, but it is incredibly worth it if you want a case that carries the Switch, the power adapter, a few joycons and a lot of games all at once while having the outside material actually being tough enough to protect them all.", "review_title": "I was in love, at first..", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}

I don't have one as I rarely play this mobile and am pretty careful with expensive products but I could see it as a negative.

I mainly use them on 2 Dualshock 4's and they don't feel like they add anything in terms of better grip or control. They do feel like they improve the general feel of a Dualshock 3, however when most ps3 games (from my experience) support the Dualshock 4 anyway (which i think is an overall better controller than the 3) it renders using my 3 pointless anyway. I cant speak for how they feel on any form of Xbox controller, whether it be the 360, Xbone or Elite, so these may be worth it for those. With the rather low price point, i don't feel any buyer's remorse, what with it being like $8, but at the same time I feel like I've gained nothing from the purchase either. I wouldn't recommend it for PlayStation players unless you're relegated solely to a Dualshock 3.", "review_title": "Utterly Neutral", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}

When it worked, the most annoying thing was the USB cable, it tended to get loose from the controller frequently, not sure if that is the port or the cable. Didn't try out the extra joysticks, though I did switch out the D Pads and didn't have much of a preference since I wasn't playing any fighting games. I didn't use the extra mapping buttons either, just never decided what to use them for. The controller definitely feels great and enjoyed it while it lasted. I turned off the Chroma as I just found it distracting and kinda annoying when it would light up the room more than the light from the TV.
