I wear it about twice a month, three hours a night - it's the watch I use when I work my night job. Well, three weeks ago the battery died. Not the end of the world - I took it to my local jeweler, who replaced the battery and then told me he could NOT get the back of the watch snapped on. He said he tried for over an hour! He felt so bad he didn't even charge me, but he recommended a local watch shop about a mile away. I went there - and he, too, couldn't get the back on the watch. I went to a THIRD watch shop - same story. Then, in desperation, I emailed Timex who said I'd hear from someone within 24 hours - that was almost three days ago. So that's it - I'm done. Am gonna buy a different watch from a different manufacturer and will NEVER buy, nor recommend, Timex watches again.", "review_title": "Watch Out for This Watch", "language": "en", "product_category": "watch"}
