I had higher expectations for this product bc of its Anker brand and now I'm very disappointed in its speed and performance. I really thought I had the best portable charger when I purchased it. :(.

PRO'S Easy Install, Clean looking, Works ok (but read on) CON'S Dark lite can't be seen during day rendered useless during day light hours. Back up camera grainy compared to other brands. Got so hot once mounted to mirror burnt my fingers (Had to use space between mirrors to vent) Back up camera dark and fuzzy to see at night (Horrible) No phone with installed sim card only works voice commands for maps.

I actually had the idea of a wearable usb cable, came on amazon, and found all the wearable cables already offered. I picked up this one due to the reviews and the looks. I think its important to note that all the people leaving bad reviews because of the \"speed\" of this cable, are wrong. This is a standard usb cable. Your data transfer rates, and charging speed, all depend on what your plugging the cable into. Leaving a negative review because of this is foolish. With this said, if your planning on using this to charge, you may want to carry around one of those little usb plugs in your pocket, but if you do that.. whats the point of the bracelet really? Be ok with the fact that it may take 8 hours to fully charge your phone in the car, or carry a plug. I'm leaving a 3 star review based on a few different things. I do like the cable, and it has actually helped me a few times to transfer files when i didnt feel like finding a usb cable. My biggest issue with the cable would be the fact that it does pop off. I have small wrists (im 190 lbs and 6 feet tall). The first time the cable popped off, i was taking out the trash. I felt it come off, and found it easily. No worries. Second time it popped off was at a concert. I didnt feel it, and someone found it and returned it. I would of lost it there if that person didnt happen to see it. There should be some sort of clasp or magnet or something to keep it attatched in my opinion. The product description says its waterproof, and it is. Ive tested it by taking it into the shower daily, and then used the cable to charge my phone. The cable holds moisture for a long while. What i mean by this, is if you take a shower at 8am, and try to use the cable at 10am, you'll get a \"moisture detected\" warning. I cant really fault the cable for doing this, as the page does recommend taking it off during the shower (after stating its waterproof). For me, this cable only works if i keep it on all the time. I'm the type of person that forgets things daily, and having it attatched to me or in my daily carry is the only option, so i tend to keep it on all the time. After about a month of use, the leather on the outside is starting to get somewhat frayed. Not a lot, but very small pieces on the side are coming up. I suspect i'll have another month or two so before it breaks down to the point where i wont use it. A very small point, the edges are a bit sharp. Especially the ones that rest on your wrist. Not a big deal for you, but if you snag someone else with em, you may give em a bit of a scrape. Hugging my son over the weekend, i ended up sliding my bracelet along his back and put a \"cat scratch\" mark on his back. Honestly it was a pretty nasty scratch, or i wouldnt bother to write it. Things to fix : A better locking system, maybe some magnets or a small latch. Round off the edges. Things to make this product sore : Figure out some way to make a foldable plug so people can get a \"fast charge\". Im not a scientist and im not an engineer but surely someone out there smarter than me can get this done.", "review_title": "A great idea.", "language": "en", "product_category": "wireless"}

I see a fairly cheap attempt to make this headset look like a quality product. The first thing you see is their failed attempt to create an \"unpacking experience\" invented by Apple and used by many companies these days. The headset comes in a plastic case. Getting this case out of the packaging foam is a challenge. The foam is very dense, like rubber, the case is slippery, and it sits in the foam very tight. I banged on the box, I turned it upside down - to no avail. I ended up prying it out with a screwdriver. The second challenge is to open the plastic box. I almost gave up and was close to returning this headset because I could not figure out how to open the case to get to the headset!!! First, it is not clear from which side it opens. There are no markings. Secondly, it is not clear how to open it. No, it would not open from just a gentle pull. I opened it after a number of failed attempts using a quarter, with the risk of breaking the whole thing. It turned out that one has to squeeze the box really hard to release the plastic latches, and while squeezing, open the box. On top of that, one has to somehow remember on which of the two sides the box opens. Hold on, it gets even worse! The headset comes with a very short micro-USB cable. Absolutely critical accessory to charge the headset. You need to always have it at hand and preferably carry it in the case, as most phone chargers are no longer micro USB. But there is no room for it in the plastic case! With some luck and with some wiggling, you may be able to somehow squeeze it into the case and close the lid - but this comes with a risk of breaking the headset or damaging the case! Once you are past this disappointment, the rest seems to work. The volume of the headset is on the low end. I had to set it to maximum to get a decent level. It sits on the ear fine. Sound quality is fine. Connection to the phone was easy. Cannot comment on long term reliability or battery life yet. The device seems to be fine, but the packaging is a disaster, the case is a disaster, the one who engineered it all should be fired. You feel from the moment you opened it that it is a low end, junky \"made in China\". I do not know who wrote all those positive reviews and what motivated them to give 5 stars to this product.

I have had to swipe very deliberately and slowly to get it to do what I actually want. * It's almost too smooth, so my fingers slip away from the area I'm working on, making it quite frustrating to do anything.

The installed mini-spade male ends are far too large to be inserted alongside the OEM connector pins in my car (it's hard to imagine what car uses such a large multi-pin connector that these would work). At first, I tried filing the connectors to a smaller size, but they then become so flexible and brittle that they can no longer be used.

The protection is moderate so if you tend to drop your phone often, consider that the coverage is not maximum. FRONT: The front of the bumper is nearly flush with the screen. When running your fingers along the edge, you can feel a small increase which gives the glass minimal protection. As long as you have protective glass your phone should be safe from damage. REAR: The rear of the bumper has little extensions on each corner and the sides are flush. The corner extensions are great and will serve as added protection for the rear glass of the phone. BUTTONS: The right sleep and on button works perfectly and is easy to control. The volume buttons are easily controlled just the same. LEFT MUTE BUTTON: This is difficult to slide to mute the phone or turn it back on only because it's set deeper into the bumper. If you're a nail biter you may not be able to use this while the bumper is on without sticking a pen or something sharp into the opening. SPEAKERS: So far so good. The speakers (both top and bottom) seem to be totally exposed allowing clear sound. POWER ACCESS: If you're using a standard apple approved power cord you'll be fine.

The hair mask was definitely a treat. I have A LOT of naturally curly fine hair, so I like to treat it well so it stays well hydrated. It was shiny and beautiful after I rinsed, dried and styled it. My regular conditioner I can leave a bit on my ends, but after having this mask on I could feel how awesome my scalp and hair felt while my hair was still wet. I did leave the mask on for about 1/2 hour instead of the recommended 15 just because I needed time for my face mask to dry and honestly, I like to keep hair masks on as long as I can tolerate it.

Night vision looks very good Image quality overall is very good. Installation is very easy, the camera uses a 4 pin plug to hook up to the main cable. It is much smaller than regular RCA jacks, making the hole that much smaller. Touch screen works well, just as good as any smartphone.

I have a MacBook Pro that I wanted to charge my watch with, but I didn't need the long cable. This charger is simple to use as it is just a USB plug with a cap and magnetic charger. The entire unit is compact which makes is great for traveling and just what I was looking for in shape and design. When put into practice, the charger fails miserably. I took screenshots of the battery level and times, and it took 3 hours to charge my watch 4%. During that time, the watch frequently made that ping sound that lets you know it is connected to the charger. That means it was constantly connecting and disconnecting to the power source. I used my wife's authentic Apple Watch charger that came with her watch on the same MacBook Pro port, and it worked perfectly. I ran this test again with a power strip that I always take on vacations. It has two USB ports on it. I ran the test a third time with a high-powered USB/AC adapter that I use for my Nintendo Switch, plugging it directly into the wall AC outlet. It has more than enough power for anything. In all three tests, this nub charger failed to charge the watch more than a few percent over many hours and it continuously disconnected, while the authentic charger charged in a very short time with no disconnects. In short, this watch charger has one job and it fails to do that job. Therefore, it is worthy of zero stars and I do not recommend it to anyone. Note that I am using an Apple Watch Series 4 and do not know if it works better with other watch series', but the chargers are interchangeable between them all, so I'm guessing it will fail for other watches.

I had to connect with Google fit which eventually pulled all data from any device into its app. I could NOT download the heart-rate data, but that's typical with Google Fit. BUT, I could not turn off the heart rate monitor. At times I would just see a flashing green light under the watch that would continue for 5-15 minutes while the watch was off. It would happen some time during the day, and then other times after a work-out when I'm trying to shower, I'd take off the watch and it would just do that. Some time when I got back from the shower, it would still be flashing and then I'd put it back on. The battery is the one thing that kills me...when I have it connected to my phone, it will go from 6:30am when I get out till about 2 or 3pm, then I put it in airplane mode to last till about 4 or 5pm, and then the screen goes dark because it's only at like 5% and will only turn on when I push the button. Currently, I can not get it to hold a charge. It says it's charging, but it was like that for 2-days now and so i'm writing this review. Pros: Light weight, loved the white color that I received. No \"flat tire\" display, integrated heart-rate monitor and transfers data to google fit. Received notifications and calls.

They shipped me new cases in different colors to see if they would help me like them more. I received a black, gold and clear case. The gold is shiny, not brushed like the actual watch is, so it's not totally something I would pick, but it does look a lot better than the clear. I used it all weekend while camping and 4 wheeling, and it did a great job protecting my watch, with little to no dust or dirt getting underneath it. Its annoying that you have to take it off to charge, because that opens up opportunity for dust to get under it when you put it back on, but I can live with it. The seller really wanted me to update my review to 5 stars, but I am still not there yet, as the gold is not a match to the watch, and therefore I dont think I will use it very often, and dont care for the black or clear, but otherwise, I think these are great cases. Original review: Punchline: I sent these back for a refund. Details: These cases will likely do a decent job protecting your watch. They cover the screen and metal on the watch. The cutouts line up nicely, and the touch screen works well with it on. That being said, it looks like crap on. The bulky clear case makes the watch look cheap and tacky. I'd rather take the risk that I might get a small scratch than have this make my watch look ugly for sure.

I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later.

Any plastic film protectors I tried on my previous phones always had very noticeable imperfections. The picture quality is well maintained and no notable differences. However this screen protector does impact the fingerprint reader. I had to re-add my fingers and do have to press much harder with more frequent \"no match found\" issues. I seem to have gotten the hang of it, but due to company protection my phone wipes itself after too many attempts which is something you should consider if you rely on fingerprint.

Anyway, I have waited quite a while before reviewing this product hoping that my problems were just my imagination and that it would eventually work. Alas no. The dongle had issues from the get-go--if I plugged both an audio cable and a power cable into my phone at the same time, it would seem to work for a short while and then the iPhone volume would drop to zero. I could move the volume slider back up, but it would then drop back to zero making it impossible to listen to anything. It works fine if I just use either the power cable side or the audio cable side, but not both at the same time. This kinda defeats the purpose of it. Recently it just stopped working altogether and I would have to unplug the audio cable and plug it back in before it would start again. Recommendation?

The main complaint from me is its short internal battery life that would often cause the camera not to start up automatically in video recording mode but stuck in the initial storage format screen waiting for user input. Because there's no GPS, the time could be off also due to battery being discharged. When you are driving the car thinking the camera was recording but to find out later that it was actually waiting for user input was frustrating. It could also potentially create a false sense of security in case of true emergency because camera may not be recording. To avoid the battery from draining completely, I have to drive my car once a day, which is not always practical on weekends. Overall, the front video quality and the display viewing angle are quite good comparing to my other dash cam. However, the rear video has zero night vision and its cable was almost too short for my midsize sedan.

I never have a problem with edge swipes and it still manages to leave a little space for the screen when setting face down. Plus it holds on very well while being super screen protector friendly, full glass protectors still leave tons of room with the case. Overall feel in hand is a little better than average I would say.

A pro is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily look like it is when it\u2019s on your wrist and when people can see it, but it is definitely fragile. Mine broke in a week. One side of the wrist band tore at the pin like a piece of paper. It was not very comfortable and the band was very stiff overall (I thought it would get less stiff with time but it broke before I could confirm). Also the pins that latch the wrist band to the watch are not similar to the ones on the wrist bands that come with the Fitbit. They were much longer and I could actually feel them pricking into my wrist. I would recommend the manufacturer try a bit harder to make a product that has specs more similar to the default product at least from a compatibility standpoint if I the comfort of the user isn\u2019t enough of an incentive.

It's a pretty good technology given the price I paid, so it's hard to complain. If these were $250 buds, it'd be a different story. The good: - they pack a lot into a small package. It's pretty amazing that these marble-sized things in my ear do what they do - the sound is fine and they work well for phone calls. I'm not an audiophile, so I have no comment on the sound purity - they stay in my ears nicely. I'm a runner and I've had no problems with them slipping/falling out - the case is nice and sleek - they hold a nice charge...I did a 3-hour run with Spotify playing and still had 80% battery left at the end The not so good: - they pair/unpair well most of the time. I sometimes switch between pairing with my phone or computer, or my phone has to choose between pairing with these buds or my car, and that can screw things up. I had to factory reset them once to get back on track. But standard use is fine -- take them out of the case and they pair with my phone...put them in the case and they unpair - the buttons on the buds are funky. They are small dots you physically press to change volume or skip track. I end up pushing hard on my ear when I push the buttons, and that's a little annoying Bottom line -- for the price, they are good, easy, out-of-the-way wireless buds", "review_title": "Pretty good for the price", "language": "en", "product_category": "wireless"}

Didn't work. I called Straight Talk, and they had me check the network mode in the settings, and found out my network mode was wrong. It couldn't be changed though. It had the option for the mode I needed but wouldn't let me select it. I then contacted Verizon, since it's a Verizon phone. They couldn't figure out what was wrong, they thought maybe my phone was locked and I should contact Samsung.

That can be a big con for some people; not so much for me, I have a couple of workarounds in mind, including an idea provided by a customer to simply carefully cut the plastic to allow the pen to charge, but I agree it\u2019s not the solution for every one.

The main things about this item i love is the strap. It is excellent when holding the phone and does stick pretty well to back of of my large otterbox defender case. The problems are that the magnetic back is extremely weak so if your phone and case is big and heavy then dont expect it to stick whatsoever to anything magnetic. Feels like only tiny baby phones will with little to no weight will make use of the magnetic mount. The kick stand is also kinda meh not able to support the weight of lage phones and cases either other then in one specific position in landscape mode otherwise it just falls over. It feels very cheap like it will break apart on you soon. Other than that the only thing that is exceptional is the adhesive that holds it to the phone and the strap but that is the only good thing about it. The kickstand ring and magnetic mount are trash when paired with big phones and cases as i have a galaxy note 10+ paired with a otterbox defender case but even then it was still trash when i used a smaller case so may or may not work for some with large phones.

First, if you buy the Garmin strap and have a small frame the strap won't work at all - it won't pick up your heart rate and is not snug even if pulled as tight as possible. The workaround to that is to use a Polar strap and cut the rubber around the sensors. This does the trip, most of the time. But I'd say at least half (if not more) of the time I look at the watch it just shows 3 lines on it - meaning it can't find my heart rate. So pretty much makes the watch completely useless. I've been using the watch for about 9 months now and although it worked ok for biking, it seems for cardio classes it just can not consistently detect my heart rate.

I had previously bought the PowerCore 26800 to take on a 2 week hike. While the battery power was awesome, it was also almost a full lb and ended up being overkill for hiking. So I got this battery bank to replace it. So far I love it! Way smaller and lighter than the 26800 but more than enough for my needs. Haven't taken it backpacking yet but used on a recent trip to NY at a sporting event and it was able to keep 3 phones charged that day! The only negative is that it does not come with a wall charger. (you can use any wall charger... but it won't charge as fast as it can with the PD wall charger). Their reasoning is people who have a PD device would already have the wall charger. I still say this is just a way for them to avoid costs as there are many more people who do not have a PD device than there are who do. I think most people would be fine with a regular charger but part of the reason I bought this is on long hikes I would need to be re-charging this battery during lunch stops in towns along the trail. I won't have hours to spend charging so was attracted to the fast charge rate listed in the description. I contacted anker tho and they did ship me out a wall charger so I'm not deducting any stars for that. The product itself, is awesome and despite the wall charger issue, I highly recommend this battery bank if you need a powerful, fast, and relatively lightweight battery. Also Anker's customer service is great.", "review_title": "Excellent Battery bank! (but get yourself a PD wall charger)", "language": "en", "product_category": "wireless"}

Too many things caused me to reconsider and I returned it. If you need a Dual Sim phone and are going to use it in a Latin American country then this would probably be a great buy. The model number of the phone says it is for Latin America according to Motorola. It comes with literature and manuals printed in Spanish. I gave the item a 3 star rating and that is really just for the phone. It's a great phone with better options then the version being sold here in the United States. It was very tempting to get an item better equipped and cheaper then what is sold for the US market. The item should probably not be sold to customers that are planning on using it here exclusively in the United States. The listing should state that. It is for GSM service only in those countries. I did call AT&T on this phone and gave them the specific numbers they needed to check compatibility. They advised me that it would work on their system. It appears even though it may work on GSM , it may not have the ability to connect to all bands that they use here in the United States. I felt the risk of dropped calls and no service was too great so I was compelled to return the phone and buy a US version.", "review_title": "The need to know on this phone!", "language": "en", "product_category": "wireless"}

Then last night, the case cracked again by the charging port. I figured it was from rough handling but Ive dropped my phone when it was in a lifeproof case and it never ever broke like this. My issue with lifeproof was always the rubber seals around the front of the phone which would break off and that would be after a year or so of use, but it was still fully functional and waterproof. Pros: The price is great. I love the volume twist to switch my phone to silent. The wrist strap is nice as well. Cons: Sound quality.

The base on the other hand feels plasticky and flimsy. I would be fine with that however assuming it worked properly. That is not the case though. The sheet of metal that you attach to your phone to mount the phone to the base is incredibly thin and I cannot for the life of me figure out why they made it neon blue. It completely ruins the case!

I had very high expectations for this earbuds but it sadly disappointed me. Pros: Cheap Good bass Customizable so it can fit well in your ears Cons: - The left earbud keeps disconnecting. I saw this on the reviews before purchasing this product and decided to ignore it and see for myself. What I have confirmed is that the problem is so severe. It probably disconnected today for more than 10 times already and it usually happens when im walking fast or turning my head to the right. - The earbuds container is bulky and gets scratched easily. It's also confusing how you have to place the earbud on the container. It's not like apple earbuds where it is easy to tell just by looking which direction the earbuds will go. For this one i found myself having to turn the earbuds so many times just for it to snap into place. This is problematic when you are in a rush like when you are walking. I have dropped the earbuds several times because of this. - the earbuds are covered in rubber. This ensures the perfect fit in your ear. Problem is that it always catches dust and lint and you have to clean it every single time. - anker advertized that these earbuds support smart assistant. It does but it's so annoying how you have to wait 2 seconds or sometimes even more for the assistant to respond. It's not instant like google pixel buds. - after prolonged use, clicking on the buttons will apply pressure to your ears and it hurts. Apple got this right cause for earbuds you just have to tap them and you dont need to apply a lot of pressure. I am truly let down by anker this time. I wish they have worked on this product really well before releasing it because products like this gives anker a bad name. UPDATE: Anker reached out to me and provided fantastic customer service. This earbuds might not be what I was expecting but because of their fantastic customer support, I will always look forward to any new products they might release in the future.", "review_title": "Review I love anker products for their quality and affordability", "language": "en", "product_category": "wireless"}

I'm still worried that if I drop my phone the front screen will break. Need to work on more coverage for the front screen as well. Two the buttons are kind of hard to push on the side. Hopefully over time this will become easier. Three (which is more a easy quick fix) oogie boogie isn't in the pic on the back.
