I have the Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogger that was a gift, but it is way too big to use as an everyday stroller. After comparing, contrasting, and praying for weeks and weeks, I decided on this J is for Jeep double stroller. Price definitely played a part in my decision, as a mom of twins, when you have to buy two of everything, you want to make the most economical choice possible. My first impression was that it was very cheap looking and flimsy. It is described as burgundy, but it looked way more purple to me. I wasn't happy about this, but I let it go after many people told me it didn't look purple to them. It is lightweight, which I love. It also does not take up much space, an important factor for a mom of 3. But the wheels are plastic, which doesn't make for the most smooth ride. The middle tires twist while the side tires to straight, which makes it wobble from time to time. In addition, it is not the easiest to close. You should be able to use your foot to kick the lever to close the stroller, but many times I find myself in the middle of the parking lot stooped down and pressing the lever by hand just to get it to close. My biggest complaint of all is that the harness does not secure my boys, no matter how tight I pull the straps. They are always able to wiggle their arms out of the chest part of the harness, then they lean forward, which propels their whole body forward, allowing them to drag their feet on the ground. They are also able to lean over and touch the wheels at this point, and there has been an occasion where one of their fingers was smashed. I am returning this stroller and plan to purchase something with better quality wheels and harnesses, or possibly even a belly bar. I like the thought of a side by side stroller so that both of my boys are able to see what's going on, and they seem to take up less space, but I may have to go with the other type. This stroller was a disappointment. The only good thing is that I don't have to use it much because we don't go out a lot where I would need it.

It is the best stroller to have (despite the problems I mention later) unless you have more $$$ for the UppaBaby Vista or another high-end in-line double. The City Select wheels are large and go easily over bumps, though you need to use strength to step on the rear axle in order to pop it over a curb. I don't know if I just got a dud because the front wheel suspension system was creaky, along with the frame. Also, the chest and waist harness straps come easily unthreaded with no pressure, which makes it very annoying to dig under the kids' bodies to buckle them in every time. Replacement straps keep having the same problem. Customer service, while not overtly rude or with attitude, is lacking. I waited over two weeks with no response to emails before I gave up and called.

You can\u2019t simply screw them together, they have weird little tabs that have to somehow weirdly line up.

Our home is entirely made of all hardwood floor and it\u2019s so cold during the winter.

My 2 year old loves playing on it and it will be great for when my newborn starts to crawl. The mat is definitely thick and cushion-y enough where it is easy on your bum when sitting on it.

The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight.

For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you\u2019re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don\u2019t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn\u2019t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you\u2019re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it\u2019s pretty much plugged in most of the time.

This bag can hold a ton of stuff, and it has so many pockets! Many of the pockets have elastic around the top, to better hold things like bottles and sippy cups. The main compartment has pockets all the way around the inside, and the two small pockets on the outside on either end of the bag also have elastic that allows them to expand and hold the items in securely. . I easily fit everything that's in my current diaper bag, into this bag. Including: a full 100-count pack of wipes, a handful of disposable diapers, four cloth diapers, a travel-sized wet bag, a sippy cup, a couple of extra outfits, a few toys, the travel changing pad, an entire roll of flushable cloth diaper liners, two burp cloths, a 16-oz bottle of water and a handful of small toys. I put all of that in the main compartment, leaving the waterproof pocket (which I would probably use to put dirty cloth diapers in, while also using the travel wet bag), and the \u201cmommy pocket\u201d empty. I still had more than enough space to put things like my phone, wallet, etc. if I didn\u2019t want to carry a purse and a diaper bag. . The main compartment zips on three sides, but it has pieces of fabric that stop it from flapping completely open. This is handy when rummaging around for something, but you don't want your stuff to slide out. And it has two zippers, so you don\u2019t have to open it all the way if you don\u2019t need to. . Convertible. You can carry this cross-body or over one shoulder with the long strap, as a backpack, or just by the top handle. The long shoulder strap is plenty long enough. And it has small straps that can be used to attach it to the back of a stroller. . The included travel changing pad is a good size, and larger than it seems in the photos. It's as wide as the bag is. . It's a good size - about the size of a backpack or small messenger bag. . The little feet on the bottom that keep the bag itself off of the ground are a nice feature, so you don't have to worry about setting it in anything questionable, or if you have to set the bag down someplace that's bound to be dirty (like a public restroom floor, an asphalt driveway, the sidewalk, etc). . It's a nice-looking bag. The coloring is nice, and I like the pattern. It's hard to find a patterned diaper bag that men wouldn't mind carrying around, too. My husband doesn't have a problem with it, and said he\u2019d carry it. The gray fabric is nice, too. It has visual texture to it. It looks almost like gray denim. I like the fact that it isn't a solid color, which would show grime a lot more. Cons . The bag is heavy, even empty. That was my first thought when I took it out of the box. I thought maybe there was something left in it, but it was just the changing pad. I think it's all of the extra straps. You could take some of them off if you're not going to use them (all of them except for the handle on top are removable), but then what's the point of a convertible bag if you do that? . There's an imperfection in the pattern of the bag I received. It's not a big deal, but it bothers me now that I know it's there. . It's an odd shape for a backpack. It looks like a messenger bag, and I think it looks a little weird when worn as a backpack. But, again, not that big a deal. Wearing it as a backpack means it won\u2019t slide forward and get in the way when you bend over, like crossbody bags do. . There are a LOT of straps. This is bound to happen with a convertible bag, though, so there really is no stopping it if you want the versatility of a bag that can be worn many ways. But I think the straps will get in the way if they\u2019re all left on the bag all the time. They\u2019d dangle down and get caught on stuff, or you\u2019d end up adjusting and re-adjusting them all the time. The shoulder strap and backpack straps are removable, though, so if you don't need them, you can take them off to get them out of your way.

The bench seat is really nice for older children. Super large basket underneath Cons: Fairly long stroller, it does help to have the extra wheels to help with maneuvering. The wheels on the bag (attaches to the stand up board) is fairly load when strolling in sidewalks with cracks. It is very large folded up and you have to take the seats off (this makes it take up the entire truck area of our Ford Flex) Overall this is a great stroller for families with children that range in age.

We have 6 of these pacifiers, but for some reason we lose them all at once. I previously bought a holder that required me to put the loop through the pacifier hole. That means the fabric of the holder was against my babies face. I can\u2019t imagine having wet fabric pressed against your face being comfortable. When I found this model I jumped on buying it. I will warn you that the holder is translucent and is already attached to one of the pacifiers. I didn\u2019t realize this and thought I threw it away. It\u2019s easy to take off and more to another one. I absolutely love it. I took a star off because the clasp is just so bulky. I wish I t was a bit smaller because against a little baby it takes up most of his torso. Other than that I highly recommend this product.", "review_title": "Finally a perfect pacifier holder", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

I had to add foam pads and make a mattress out of them so she can sleep comfortably at night. I do absolutely love the toy bar and the diaper bag on the side which can be removed and carried by itself. I also enjoy that the surface is simple to clean if anything should happen while changing the baby or if they happens to throw up. Bassinet part works great and is very secure. However the changing pad I never used because it is so flat I'm almost a hundred percent sure my child would just roll off of it I would never trust it and never did.

You never know how clean a person's floor is and with this thing you don't have to worry about a safe, clean place for your infant to roll around on. And its certainly more comfy to play on than wood or tile. Once my kid could crawl, it's nearly impossible to keep her on it but I still use it to maximize it's potential for keeping my carpets clean. My cat likes to run across it which has resulted in several small holes in it. They don't go all the way through so it still protects baby and floor but it means that the insides are a bit exposed (it's kinda spongey) so when you clean it by any means more intense than a wipe down, it has to dry out a while. I still highly recommend it to anyone. Many people have asked me where to get one and I tell them.

BUT, as soon as your infant starts to roll over or push with her legs it's time to move on. My 4-1/2 month old almost pushed herself out of it yesterday. Her head was completely past the top. I'm not sure if it would have tipped over because the rest of her was still inside and her legs were already fully extended, but it was enough of a wake-up call for me to put her on the floor. She was not tied down, but I doubt the safety belt would have kept her secured - even when I belted her in she pushed out of it. A 3- or 5-point harness system would definitely be an improvement.

This was one of the top bags I kept reading about. I exclusively pump for my baby and we started to travel quite a bit once he turned 6 months old. I was really stressed about how to take milk with me and how to take so much. I thought the bag would be a bit larger, but it ended up working out. We were away for 7 days for our first trip and I noticed by stuffing this bag with frozen breastmilk, it actually kept all my milk bags frozen. Only one bag (up top) had started to defrost, but was still slushy. The entire duration of the trip was 5-6 hours. I ended up ordering a second bag because I was not able to fit a week's worth of milk supply in the bag (baby was still drinking 6-7 feedings at this time). It wasn't too big of a problem. Due to traveling alone, I packed both bags into my suitcase right before leaving. On the trip back, I ended up taking it out and carrying it through TSA due to the weight it was adding to my suitcase (7 pounds)!! Our second trip was just a few days ago. I didn't take as much milk and I did notice more of the milk bags had started to defrost, but still frozen enough to put back in the freezer once I arrived at my destination. We will be traveling to Cabo in a couple of months. I am a little nervous since the flight will be longer than both of our previous trips, but I also do not have a choice and will need to make the best of the situation. I plan to take a lot of milk.

There were two reason I decided on the Britax Boulevard. 1. It was rated as one of the easiest car seats to install properly. 2. It has an ARB (Anti Rebound Bar) I've read articles that state that the number one cause of injuries to children in carseats is because the car seat is not installed properly. So #1 was extremely important to me. I have had limited experience with other brands, but I can say that the ClickTight helps get the car seat much tighter much easier than some other models. My only issue is that the base of the car seat is pretty wide and therefore can make it very difficult to reach the tether that is used when utilizing the anchors in the car. Some cars are easier than others, but that is probably the only time consuming part of installing and removing the seat. The strap on the tether is difficult to loosen which makes things harder. The only other negative i have to say is that you have to recline the seat before installing. That may be standard for all car seats, but I found that annoying considering how difficult the seat is to remove and loosen when already installed. That is the only reason i give it a .5 star below a 5. My son was very comfortable in this seat almost immediately... I saw a huge difference in his comfort when comparing to the infant only car seat. Overall, for a convertible car seat, I would highly recommend this one.", "review_title": "My only issue is that the base of the car seat is pretty wide and therefore can make it very difficult to ...", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

First off I absolutely love how soft and flexible this bib and the vibrant colors and the cute designs make it even better. I love how its not just one button that the neck can be looped through but there are 3 buttons in which I can loop it through in order to avoid my daughter from taking off the bib herself. Now on to why I was 1 star short of 5, this bib would be the perfect bib for going out because of how soft it is, it makes it very easy for me to put it away without having to fiddle for the necessary space for it to fit. However if you plan on using this bib with your highchair there may be a bit of a problem with the flexibility. In most cases for high chairs used at home there is a tray and depending on your high chair tray it may or may not blend the bib into a form where no food will be caught, which is exactly what happens to me. The bib folds inwards where the food cannot be caught and my daughter ends up having all the soup, food, crumbs, etc all over her legs. I don't need to worry about her getting cut from the bib but the softness of the bib causes problems where the bib is ultimately not catching anything that is falling. Given the material of the bib and how much I like it once I took it out of the box I had to give 4 stars. The pocketed bib is completely defeated in the case of the highchair tray but I'm sure when we are out and sitting in restaurant highchairs the bib will be differently seen.
