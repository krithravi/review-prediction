I go through a lot of sunscreen. I've always just used popular, grocery store brands, but last summer my skin started to get bumpy after sunscreen application. I thought maybe it was from the chemicals, that my skin was sort of trying to reject the toxins it was soaking up from the cream. I've never had any other skin reactions to any kind of detergents, fabrics, perfumes, or any kind of substance, so I wouldn't describe my skin as particularly sensitive. Last month I was going to Italy on a dream vacation and needed to take sunscreen along, so I decided to try Goddess Garden to avoid all those chemicals in regular sunscreen. I also liked that it was eco/reef friendly. Unfortunately, while I did not get sunburned, it wreaked havoc on my skin. After applying it on two consecutive days, my skin became rough feeling and itchy, and my face was super puffy. I went a few days trying to stay out of direct sunlight with no sunscreen and the puffiness went down, but my skin was still feeling pretty rough. On day five, we were going out on a boat, so I couldn't avoid sunscreen. The puffiness returned and the roughness remained. So I went to a pharmacy and bought different sunscreen which I used daily for the next two weeks. The puffiness never returned and after about a week and lots of gentle exfoliating, I shed the rough patches of skin except for on my neck where it took about another week to fully clear up. My best guess is the minerals were just to harsh for my skin as I do not have eczema and have never had any skin allergies.", "review_title": "Did not work for my skin", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

The plates include a wide variety of designs, most of which I can see myself using. I also like the carrying case, it's much nicer than having them loose or rubber banded together. However, the plates themselves are not etched very deeply, so some designs don't pick up well or end up being somewhat sheer due to the very thin layer of polish. Some of the designs are oddly warped or stretched, and I suspect several are knock-offs of other brands. The edges of the plates and etching are also pretty sharp, I cut myself once removing the blue film and again trying to get a plate out of the carrying case sleeve, and the etching tears at cotton pads when I clean them. I have plates from another brand, Ejiubas, and the difference is very obvious, they are etched deeper and the edges are smooth and safe. The stamper in this kit is also not very good, I can't get it to pick up designs (not a problem with my other clear jelly stampers). Also, the whole point of a clear stamper is that you can look down through it and see where you are placing your design, but this stamper is two-sided so the end you aren't using obscures the view of the working end.

I used it trying to get rid of a few pimples and ended up stripping my skin of all of its natural oils. This left my skin red, especially around the mouth area, my lips were completely dry for one week. My skin became so raw I ended up contracting a staph infection. I first thought is was just a few pimples but then realized it was much worse when it spread all over my face, the worse being my chin, where I focused most when using the cleanser. A simple three times of using this product in one week has become one month's worth of problems. I am now on antibiotics and lots of moisturizing because my skin has become so dry. I have my wedding in a few months, and now I just hope it clears up before then. I give it two stars still because not everyone will have the same worse case scenario as I did. But just be very aware if you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you. I thought my oily skin would be able to handle this product but clearly this was much too harsh for me. There are three pictures of me, one when I first noticed there was an issue with me using this cleanser so I stopped washing my face with it. The next two are of my chin area about one month after I stopped using the cleanser. I did not post pictures of the rest of my face which also has red pumps all over, but nothing as bad as my chin.", "review_title": "Oily skin?

Like the other blades I\u2019ve bought, you can feel a difference between the first use or two and the subsequent cuts as the edge wears in. But the overall feel was vastly different - the first two cuts with the old blades seemed to be as close as a classic straight razor, while the first few uses with these felt more like getting plucked. After the wear-in period, the old blades cut pretty well, needing a couple of passes to get a truly clean cut (with the number of passes creeping up over the following months)...these seemed to immediately go to the year-old dullness level. The ultimate failure of these blades was evidenced by my shave this morning. The mirror was fogged up and I didn\u2019t have a lot of time before heading off to work, so I made the usual three or four passes, emptied some cuttings out of the head of the shaver, and got on with the day.

I really feel like I'm missing that scrubbing to really lift that white residue from in between my taste buds and other little crevices that are on my tongue. If you never clean your tongue, this will definitely help you. If you already brush your tongue with your toothbrush, this will, at best, match what your toothbrush can already do.

It does smell like men's after shave so I use unscented baby wipes to remove before applying my foundation. BTW -- I apply it with a cotton ball. I have to shave every day and this stuff is great. Only one drawback -- it will cause your nail polish to smear. I keep a box of foodservice gloves handy to prevent my nail polish from smearing.

I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Tyme curling wand thing. I just got my package today and immediately plugged it in. I have bleached hair so I set it on the medium heat, or one close to the middle. I literally had curls like 2 minutes later. The first swipe straightened my hair. Then I remember another reviewer said you have to turn the barrel as you go down the hair, so that's what I did. I sort of kept wrapping it as I was sliding it through my hair. One important thing is to make sure that little lip on the wand is the side that is close to your scalp. I forgot that part and accidentally singed my forehead, I hope the burn isn't too bad! Anyway, so here is a picture I took. This literally took me like 5 minutes on dirty hair. All I did was brush out my hair and pop in a few curls, VERY pleased with how easy it is. It does sort of pull on your hair a bit, but I'm sure I will get better with that in time. And yeah, they aren't perfect, but this was my first time and I wasn't going for perfection, I was trying to see if it worked. I hope this helps someone else make the decision. Oh yeah, my hair type is fine.", "review_title": "This curls! Like for real, look at my pic.", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

In the beginning of the year, I started having a new sever and embarrassing allergic reaction on my face - forehead, eyes, ears, neck. Not only did it look horrible, but it itched terribly. The doctors didn't help! I had a feeling I was allergic to something in the shampoo I was using so started my search for a natural shampoo without betaine (which is the hardest to find). I stumbled on this Raw Soapberry Shampoo and decided to try it. My skin slowly started to calm down. It took a month to completely heal.

THIS WASH IS DIFFERENT. Now, I wouldn't say that my face is miraculously clear or anything like that, but it's not getting worse. Why I give this 5 stars is because the smell is clean and not to overpowering, my skin has not been drying out, my towel has not bleached anything like it was before with the other washes, and it leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.

It's classy, beautiful and fashionable. My wife and daughter love this pearl hairpin. It is indeed a good choice as a gift.Hairclips are a bit bigger than I thought. It can pin all my daughter's hair (she is 9 years old has beautiful long hair). But my wife and daughter look great with this hairpin.The artificial pearls are securely fastened and look to be good quality too. After days of use, they still look as they did when they arrived. I was very surprised at how nice it all is for the price.One thing to note is that the decorative pins have nothing on the end of it to stop the hair slipping out. And the clips can get caught on the pearl and not close properly if you are not careful. So they will not hold your hair in place without something else supporting them. The value for money of these pearl pins and clips is brilliant. They may not be perfect, but the limitations are easy to work around.

It's really difficult to fully rinse out with just water and leaves an greasy-feeling residue behind if you don't shampoo a second time with an alternate product.

Now, it will only epilate for a few minutes before I have to put it back on the charger. Unfortunately, you cannot use this epilator while it is plugged into the charger, so it is kind of frustrating that you can't just power through and get the epilating over with in one sitting. With that being said, it does a really good job of actually epilating. My leg hairs grow quickly, so I have to epilate once every 2 weeks. This has been an okay first epilator, but honestly if I could send this one back I would. I will probably buy one in the future that will work while it's plugged in so I don't have to wait in between charges to use it.

I have been looking for a replacement and so far have purchased 7 various models of antenna from Target and Wal-Mart and have been very disappointed. Not one has come close to the damaged one i am trying to replace. I will say that of all of the purchases this model from Amazon comes in the best, but unfortunately only picks up less then half of the channels that my parents damaged discontinued Phillips Rabbit ears are able to pickup in their current condition. This is far better then the other new models I have tried that do not even pick up a quarter of the channels. This model is very light and feels cheaply built, but I have found This the case with the other units I have tried. This is very forgivable if it works the same as or better then the ones I am trying to replace. Newer technology and newer materials in theory should make a better antenna and I will continue to look for it, but if you don't have anything and need one, so far sadly this is the best in this price range as I found at this time. I am amazed by the customer support for this product it is fantastic. They try very hard to help. For this type of support I moved my rating from a 2 to a 3.

NO! it is not affordable for me! Surprisingly I found this Phoebe mouth guard for my grinding teeth, which can save me a lot of money, and to be honest I did not have high expectation in the beginning but the price is so good for me then I decided to have a try, and never thought it could work so well to stop the damage from teeth fringing! Here are some tips of what I have done as below: 1. Drop the mouth guard into the hot water. (one piece at a time), and just lightly hot warm water. 2. Use a wooden spoon to scoop the guard in the hot water and shake off all hot water. 3. Grab the guard and place it on the row of teeth you are molding. Use the indention in the center of the guard to line it up with the center of your row of teeth. 4. Once it is in your mouth, close your mouth and begin to suck in--almost as if there is food stuck on your teeth that you're trying to remove without a toothpick. Also, while you're doing that, press down your lips towards your teeth to give it an extra help to mold to the front of your teeth. Use your tongue to get inside in place. 5. Keep the guard in your mouth until you feel it firm up. It'll probably take a minute or so to set. In addition, there are 3 packs with optional sizes to choose from, it was slightly tricky to get it to perfectly set comfortably on my teeth. But that is fine--if you don't get it the first time you can always try to reset it by dunking the pieces back into the hot water. By the 2nd (or 3rd) it should be pretty easy to get it exactly the way you want to be.", "review_title": "works well for me", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

Some of the curls looked good for the first few minutes, but others had weird kinks in them, and the desire to run my fingers at least through the roots to blend the sections again ruined the curls.

I lightly ran my fingers through the roots only, which went right back to the style from the day before and gently separated the curls.

I found myself going back to manual toothbrushes as I wasn\u2019t going to buy new heads on a product that is so annoying. I\u2019m sure there are many ways to laud this product but I\u2019m just not feeling the vibes here. for the price I paid I could have bought a LOT of manual toothbrushes just pay attention to how I brush like any normal person should be able to do and save myself the time and trouble. I would not buy again.", "review_title": "Good toothbrush although terrible Bluetooth connectivity. Would not repurchase or recommend.", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

Usually something red will turn to green or the battery icon will stop flashing and be steady or the battery light will go off when charged, but this thing did none of that. Over 90 minutes later and the battery was still flashing. There is nothing in the barely legible instruction paper about what means charged. I left it plugged in overnight and it was still flashing in the morning so I tried it out. It worked okay but is pretty weak in my view. After use, I plugged it in and the battery light did not come on at all, just the red light. Charged? Not charged? Charging? Who knows. About a minute late later, the battery started flashing on and off again. People who make these items need to get their act together and use standard methods of information to display. As I said above, most things go from red to green when charged. Easy peasy. Or, they flash when charging and go solid when charged. This thing stays red apparently all the time and maybe or maybe not flashes when charged. I still don't know.

I have very fine and oily hair. I wanted to reduce waste, both monetary and product. I believe this will do both, only had it for a couple weeks. The shampoo lathers really well. The tangerine scent which I originally felt was overwhelming, is actually softer when you're washing and my hair just smells clean with maybe a hint of citrus after its dry. The shampoo took me a bit to get used too, it leaves my hair feeling heavy (I think is the best way to describe it) but after I use conditioner (which I use everytime) it gets lighter and softer. The conditioner does not lather at all really. I'm not sure if I use more than average, but I feel like I have to swipe it through my hair several times to get enough. It already shows some wear. Not sure how long it will last. The shampoo only takes a few swipes to get alot of lather going. I assume I'll be ordering conditioner more often than shampoo. The packaging could have been a bit better. It did come in a pretty box and the reusable containers are nice. Although the spare shampoo came in a cupcake liner sandwiched between the 2 containers. Which would have been perfectly fine, but it left shampoo all on the bottom of one the containers that I had to clean off. Not difficult or anything. But they had enough tissue paper already in the box that, had it been wrapped differently, that could have been avoided. Overall I like it, and my naturally oily hair has not looked or felt oily using it. Price wise I think this is a great deal. I may try some other brands still. But only because I'd like some comparison and to see if I like anything better. Also I don't understand why they give you 2 shampoo and only 1 conditioner in the pack. The conditioner bar is smaller than the shampoo bar as well.", "review_title": "Works great for my thin and oily hair.", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

If you use this on your indoor plants you MUST Spray Outside. I live in Ohio, so spraying in the winter is not really an option. Results from spraying: a smelly smell that will smell so smelly you will smell it for weeks. Residue from the oil may go everywhere and it is sticky and unpleasant and difficult to remove. You may have sprayed your plant outside, let it air out, then bring it in and see that you missed a spot. One squirt won't be a big deal. I'll just spray one squirt inside. NO. DON'T DO IT. The cast off may get on your plant, but it could also go on objects around the plant. Then it is suddenly on the window shades, the desk, oh no it's dripping off of the plant and onto the floor, its on the carpet. How did it get on the printer? Who sprayed it on the wall? Why is the cat sticky? What is that smell? No. No. No. No. Real Talk: this neem oil may suffocate the bugs, but it is also capable of suffocating your plant. I had a mealy bug infestation brought in from a new succulent (thanks Lowes) and used neem oil on the affected plants. My poinsettias where a delicious treat for these bugs, so I used this neem oil on them. They died. The neem oil killed them because the leaves were so sensitive. When I tried to wash the oil off to save the plants it wouldn't come off. One by one the leaves fell off and soon my beautiful 4-year-old poinsettia died. RIP. Look how beautiful she was! I gave it two stars because it was helpful to kill the bugs on succulents, so that's a plus.

If you want to take months to slowly reduce the size of the skin tag, this may be effective, but I wanted mine gone and improvised ways to apply more. 2. Be warned, if you do want to apply more than a toothpick-tip-worth of the remover, it will also get on the surrounding skin and cause a nasty looking scab. I had a tag about half the size of a pencil eraser on my forehead and it is essentially gone after a week. However, the in-between states were not nice to look at so just be aware of that before you use on exposed areas like your face. Overall, I would recommend it.

Cons: The brush is shortened, so it's a little awkward to put polish on. I personally don't like it. Second, the first coat goes on pretty smooth, but the the second coat is almost impossible to put on smoothly, without vertical lines. It seems like the polish does not level itself out because it's too thick and dries while brushing it on the nails. I can never put it on evenly. So, that pretty french manicure you are looking for, is very hard to achieve. The consistency was too thick the first time used it. I only used 3 times, so not really sure if it actually helps. Instead I bought Advanced Hard As Nails in Natural Pink. Much easier to work with, brush size is normal, coats evenly and levels itself out, dries fast (but not when I am still polishing).

As I was rinsing my hair, I noticed it had a, sort of, sticky, stringy feel to it. I got out of the shower and applied some Sun Bum Leave In Conditioner to my ends. As my hair air-dried, it took on this slick, almost wet, dirty appearance. As if I had left either shampoo or conditioner in it accidentally. The more it dried, the more apparent it was. It also felt....thick, stringy, and coated. I decided that maybe it was the Sun Bum Leave In Conditioner; perhaps I had applied too much. The next day, I washed my hair again and, this time, I used my normal conditioner. After drying my hair, I was disappointed to see it looked the same way; oily, coated, stringy, like I had left product in it. Today is day 3 and I am giving it another shot. Still felt sticky and stringy upon rinsing the shampoo out in the shower. My hair is still wet, so I will have to see how it dries. So far, it's not looking good-literally or figuratively...I will continue to use it as body soap, so it doesn't go to waste, but this will not be touching the top of my head again anytime soon!", "review_title": "Definitely NOT a Shampoo Bar-Not for hair anyway", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

There is too much going on with the phone, and maybe someday I will respect it but, currently it just confuses me. My love of photography is the only reason I mess with the phone at all, it took a long time to recover and eventually, your friends stop coming around or calling you.

All our photos are almost all of them with me behind the camera. I am excited to work with the different telescopes to take different types of pictures.

It's light years beyond what I was expecting in terms of quality construction. That being said, the only bad part is the comb arm. Again, made out of milled stainless steel, it may very well outlive the cockroaches after the big one, BUT it just blows as a comb. The teeth are too shallow and too widely spaced to function well as either a beard or hair comb, and the right-angle killing of the comb teeth has a habit of snagging, breaking, or outright simply pulling out your hair. Great for irony: it's a switchblade comb that doesn't work as a comb! Be careful you don't get shot or punched whipping it out because it's pretty convincingly deceptive even from a short distance.

I like smooth legs and I've been shaving everyday since I started shaving as a teen. After getting into the shower and opening the sugar scrub the first thing I noticed was the very pleasant, but not too heavy, scent of coconut...immediately brought me the white sand beaches of Hawaii...a great way to start any morning! After exfoliating my legs for several seconds I rinsed thoroughly to make sure I didn't get any leftover granules stuck in my razor blade. From there I applied a very small amount of Bikini Soft Coconut Oil (a small amount goes a very long way...especially because your legs will already have a thin layer of oil on it remaining from the sugar scrub). After applying the oil, I shaved regularly using the razor I'd been using for several weeks in the shower (I don't change blades too frequently and this was NOT a new blade). Because I was using oil I was extra careful to make sure I thoroughly rinsed my razor so as not to clog it up with any remaining oil. Running my hands over my legs to see if I missed any spots I immediately noticed how much smoother my legs felt than with my typical method of shaving cream. After exiting the shower and drying off, I went to put a bit of moisturizing lotion on my legs which is what I normally do post shave/shower...again I was struck by how soft and smooth my legs felt...honestly I could have skipped the moisturizing process entirely as my legs already felt silky soft and smooth but old habits die hard and I always figure more moisture is better than not enough! The true test came when I went to change for bed and ran my hands across my legs...the smooth and soft feeling lasted all day ! A few days later I used the same process to shave my bikini line and underarms...same results and more importantly...no annoying razor burn! I love this new method of shaving and I love the smell of Bikini Soft !", "review_title": "Baby soft legs after just one use!", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

I was down to almost no eyebrows at all and spent my mornings drawing on eyebrows. I HATE that! I was considering my options and was almost at the point of having eyebrows tattooed on. Then I came across this item on Amazon. It was expensive, but I figured what the heck. I may as well try it before I take on the permanent tattoo option. WOW! I followed the directions and put it on my brows twice a day. Once in the morning and once before bed. 5 weeks later I had eyebrows. The tiny tube lasted almost exactly 5 weeks. Why only 4 stars you ask? The tube is tiny and expensive. Much like any other hair growth product it seems that you will require continued use to keep from losing your brows. Maybe not twice a day, but probably a light coat once a day. I stopped using the product and my brows seemed to thin. I purchased another tube to stop the thinning but they seemed to be resistant to regrowth. I am satisfied with my brows right now. I decided to try an eyebrow growth product from a different manufacturer. I received 2 tubes the same size for half the price. So far so good. All of that being said, if I find that my brows are again disappearing, I won't hesitate to purchase this product. It really works for brow regrowth!!!", "review_title": "Wow!

He did not get a Pokemon or Littlest Pet Shop but rather some super cheap weird cat thing. He was dissappointed, I was mad. I contacted the seller again and they apologized and sent me a replacement, again assuring me that I was getting bath bombs with Pokemon toys. Again, same weird cat toy, one had a Pokemon, and the last another weird cat toy in another color. I contacted them again and explained that I wanted to have a chance to make the situation right before I left a review. After a few days I received a reply of now they need my address and phone number to send me a new one. At this point I just wanted them to acknowledge their mistake and fix their posting because it is misleading.

It is my second. The first one still works and I keep it for the features the second one does not have. Like a smaller clipper head for trimming around the sideburns. (But, hey, you can purchase a second clipper to do the job that the original clipper used to do...) The reason I purchased this second clipper was because the first clipper comb attachment tabs broke off, rendering the device usable but severely compromised. This second clipper - albeit lighter in weight - still suffers from the same design 'flaw' - (read: planned obsolescence) that the first one had and from which this second one will, no doubt, suffer. The problem is that the comb is very difficult to remove for cleaning and to reinstall for normal use. The plastic tabs (the ones that broke in the original clipper) are ridiculously difficult to work with. You're never quite sure they're in or out or how to hold/squeeze the dam thing to get them in or out. I do not want to manhandle this thing, but I am almost forced to by this ridiculous (but, obviously profitable) design.

Also, having 3 heat settings and low, medium and high settings is fantastic ! It's like what you would get with a more expensive hairdryer. I've always wanted a medium setting and on warm . Most of the cheaper ones only have hot and cool . Also the cheaper ones only have high and low on the air flow . Plus the comb attachment is thicker and a better quality. The thing I really like is the thick round Cord on the dryer. It's not like the standard flat electric cord on most appliances, very good quality .

This time I have some early observations for you to consider. This order, like the 1st order from a different maker, came 4 to the set. Bamboo handles. Charcoal coated or infused bristles. So here's the info you should know: Bamboo handles are a pleasure to hold & use with a smooth comfortable shape. Charcoal Bristles offer no benefits that I can identify. If in fact they are black due to Charcoal, I feel, see, and taste no difference compared to the non-charcoal brushes I've used throughout my life. Also, the Bristles are very soft which I've adjusted to but wonder if a stiffer bristle would clean/polish my teeth more effectively than these very soft bristles. Of course if you like a soft bristle than you might like this brush as they feel very nice. A nicely priced set of 4 that will appeal to some folks and I can recommend them for design, and quality of build & finish.", "review_title": "Unexpected results... but it's all good.", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

There is no way to get these white particles out of the powder. There are just too many. Therefore, these two dip powders are not usable. I reached out to the company, who acknowledged this was an ongoing issue, and promised a replacement had already been shipped. However I have yet to receive it and it has been 2 weeks. My nails last about 2 weeks before they start chipping.

It washed out very easily, but so did a lot of the color. But the change is noticeable and I will continue to try. You get a good amount for the price and it will last a long time. Also, it applies clear but will leave stains after a few days to anything it comes in contact with. Try it out. It does work. Update: So, it appears that this was basically dying my hair and when I wash my face, almost all of the color is gone. Not working as I originally thought. I even purchased an atomizer and I am really rubbing into the skin, but not seeing the results I'd hoped for. I was very optimistic and I wanted an alternative to the dyes that burn my skin, but this doesn't look like it will do the job, at least for me.

The light that indicates that the unit is on is very bright, it bothers me a bit at night when trying to sleep.

I only bought these to help my tropical plants in summer, and even then, humidity never went past 45%. But since I live in the California desert, I will take any humidity increase I can.

As someone who is fairly comfortable with putting false lashes on with lash glue, I find these extremely difficult to put on. The length of the magnet is fairly short.

It's like when you wear false lashes and one of the corners doesn't stay on so you have that lash peeking out. I may have to cut them, but I think they will end up looking like corner lashes instead of full lashes. I think with better practice, this may work out for me BUT it might take more magnetic lashes since you have to be extremely gentle with them or else they start to fray/peel off the band and lose its original form.

They are sturdy but lightweight and feel good to my hand. And they come in many colors and designs. However this one in the pink flowers does not have an embossed \"Wet\" logo just beneath the brush area. All my others have it. In the pictures offered of this product, one shows it with an embossed \"Wet\" and another without. Also mine arrived with white nubs on the ends of the bristles, whereas one ad shows all black, while another shows white-tipped. My brush does say (in print, same as the pink flowers) \"Wet brush\" on its handle. I just want to make sure I purchased a legit \"Wet\" brand. Otherwise it seems like a good brush. I've had this particular one only a week, so I'm still trying it out. The way I clean and wash my Wet brushes is to pull out as much loose hair from them as I can with my hand. Then with a regular hair brush with soft bristles, I will brush it to remove the rest of the hairs, pulling them from the other brush. Or you could use a soft bristle scrub brush. Then I get both wet, put liquid soap on one and gently scrub the brushes together. That also brings up loose hair so you can grab and pull it out. Then I rinse both very well and dry upright on a wash rag. If you have thick curly hair or a lot of hair accumulated, you could try using the end of a rat tail comb down each row and pull up hairs before washing. Wet brushes seem to survive fairly hot tap water. Though I don't know I'd soak them in it. Likewise, I wouldn't put them in the dishwasher as some do. They might melt or the colors will fade away much faster than they normally would.", "review_title": "It's pretty and so far so good, but lacks a Wet embossed logo where they usually have one.", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

The price is good too, especially since I've been used to buying high end creams for $50 and over, so this is definitely a great change for my pocket. The only problem I have with this product is that the bottle comes as a pump and the pump was broken in every single bottle I received. I received 4, that includes 2 replacements that I hoped would have a working pump. So to use the cream I had to break the bottle and put it in a different container. I tried that with the first bottle and after liking the cream, I did the same for the remaining bottles. I probably won't buy anymore due to the inconvenience of having to break the container, but I definitely like the cream enough to keep what I already have. It's texture is smooth and it is not greasy. After 2 weeks of use I can definitely feel the change in my overall skin appearance, smoothness and texture. I have oily skin and this product is also great for oily skin, because it is not greasy and I don't feel like it's caked on or clogging my pores.

The black color is the blackest of black, the finish is pure matte, and as long as you apply it properly, it goes on smooth and NEVER flakes. It is the ONLY liner that holds up to my oily eyelids (I don't always like to use primer). The felt tip gives the ultimate level of control and precision, whether I want thick or thin lines, and the \"inkwell\" container always worked well for me. I use this liner everyday and can get a good 4-5 months use from it. It's the best liquid liner at such a great price. Although, I love this liner to death, the bottle and applicator aren't as weighty in the hand now and have a somewhat cheaper feel. Maybe they're trying to decrease the amount of plastic in their packaging so I guess that's OK. Now, about the formula, their liner used to last a whole day PLUS all night of wear up until the next day. Since maybe about 4 or 5 years ago it seems to last all day and only a small part of the night, then it needs a bit of fixing and refreshing. This liner still beats any other liquid liner out there except for maybe its own past formula. I don't know if they really did change it, but it just seems that way to me. All that aside, the ONLY reason I am giving 3 stars and not 5 is because I recently purchased the liner and without even opening it yet, saw a clear brownish liquid leaking from the bottle. I requested a replacement (Amazon said I didn't have to send the original one back) and what I received had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I know they didn't just send the same one back to me because I still have the original one I purchased.

Everything about the wig is perfect \u2014 the color, the texture, the length, and the density. The only thing I dislike about the wig is the part. It is a middle part and it is impossible to part anywhere else. It is not a lace front wig \u2014 which is what I expected when I ordered it; however, there is some sort of weird white plastic right under the part that is painfully obvious. You would have to be albino for the part to look believable. Unfortunately, I can only wear this wig with a hat or if I style the top in such a way that the part is hidden. This was a big enough deal for me that I had to only give this wig 2 stars. If you\u2019re looking for something to wear out in public day to day, this is not a wig for you.

I recommend not using any lotions or face creams prior to using this, or at least waiting ample time between, then you should have no issues with burning, also make sure your face is totally clean first, especially of eye makeup. I have been using it once a day at night time right before bed.

It does tend to shed a lot but since I got the product recently, I don't know if this will affect the overall look of the hair after a while. For the price though I'll just order another one if it does. One qualm I have with all pony tail extensions is I hate the wrap around part. I have thin hair and the wrap around part gets wrapped like 5 times to wrap it all which makes a huge knot looking thing at the base of my ponytail.

That is the case here. I was well aware that I would be plunking down over $30 (+tax) for little tubes of plastic worth two bucks but decided to do this because this company claimed to be the first, best, authentic and could have had some advantage over other brands. My critique: (1) The pack has two large cups and two small ones. I would have preferred just two for half the price or, for $30, an assortment of four sizes. I only would use one at a time of the same size. (2) For a normal or small face with structure instead of fat, the large one does not work. It loses suction unless it goes over a broad area, preferably with fat, like the cheeks. For most of the face, going over features and contours, it lost contact and lost suction. The small one was okay for small areas and under the eyes, but obviously too small and therefore too strong for the large areas of the face. The woman in the demos on their website has a very broad and fat face, very plump lips, so the large cup suited her. (3) I felt ripped off at the high price. For what it is, even if it worked for me, the price is gouging. I went to the website for the \"free\" booklet and it turns out to not be a download. They require me to give them my personal information so that they can email the booklet to me. I wonder what advertisers they would sell my information to. No thanks. The concept is great, though not original. It is similar to the folk remedy of cupping that uses material soaked in alcohol is set on fire to create a vacuum inside an upturned glass and then the glass is placed on the skin. The idea of converting this into a smaller unit that could be used on the face is brilliant, but the size is not right for everyone, maybe not even for most.

I figured it would do the same for my face. I wet the brush as suggested for my first use and I did not like that. It was way too soft. Now I only use it dry. I started off and actually continue to dry brush every other day. The first few times my face turned burning red a few hours after the dry brush. This lasted for maybe 2 days. It felt like I had applied retinol to my entire face or got a sunburn. I kept going. I got a few pimples. I kept going. My pimples have healed and now my skin is dry and peeling in some places. Exact same reaction as I had to retinol. (Prescription retinol cream). I started to use argon oil on the peeling skin and that has helped. My skin is so soft and when the peeling settles down and it will my skin will be new and lovely. I no longer get red from the dry brushing and I am not getting pimples. It\u2019s probably been two weeks of use. I don\u2019t see much of a difference in my pores, (I have a magnifying mirror). My face feels tighter yet softer. My goal was to nix some of the slack in my skin and maybe help loosen up some wrinkles. I see improvement in my laugh lines but not forehead wrinkles. Pretty sure the skin is now leather on my forehead so that may take some time. Also gently working on eye wrinkles. The goal is to just get some blood circulation to that area. As a result my under eye area has seen less fluid accumulation ie bags. I love the idea and this brush is working well for me. It\u2019s the only Facial brush I have tried so I have no comparison. I think the stiffness of the brush dry is perfect. Wet it was too soft for my 45 year old weathered skin.", "review_title": "Perfect dry, too soft wet.", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}

As of now I can say I opened the package last night to test the product for functionality and to ensure it works before I give it to my daughter for XMas. The packaging was nice and smelled great, the box which holds the oils is so pretty (nice job). The diffuser itself was a little difficult to remove the cap but once it came off it was easy to put back on. The mist went all throughout the room for about 1 minute then my daughter decided to turn it off. As I said today is day 1 of having it but so far so good.", "review_title": "So far so good - Day 1", "language": "en", "product_category": "beauty"}
