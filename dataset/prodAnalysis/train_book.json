In short, there is always a bounce between the first, unprepared test score and the second score a student receives after becoming familiar with the test.

I have also taken a full C# course on Udemy that was about 18 hrs long and have been writing code for about 2 years consistently (nearly daily) as a hobby... NOW.. The Good: I think that this entire book series is GREAT for SUPPLEMENTAL learning. It's really nicely structured and provides a lot of great code examples and you know exactly what your looking at. It's so good in fact, that I would probably buy the second and third books in the series (mainly the third) again just for reference. The Bad: My two biggest criticisms of this book are its redundancy and not beginner friendly (which is in the title)... This book is far more code than explanations. This is not a problem in itself, however, There is often little to no deep explanation along with each example and it commonly repeats the phrase \"this will be discussed in more detail later\". Most of the code shows you how to write things, but no real explanation on how to use what you would have learned. A large portion of the book is spent repeating itself in explaining how the code would look if you used another data type (basically changing out 1 word). So for people who haven't written a line of code before, the best way I could explain is, if the author was describing a ball: If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later. This is a ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a blue ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a blue ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a red ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a red ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a green ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a green ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a purple ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a purple ball ...Anyways that's pretty much what this book is. If that's what you're looking for, that's what it has. Buy it or don't....", "review_title": "Useful for SUPPLEMENTAL learning...", "language": "en", "product_category": "book"}

I use a Pilot g2 and Staedtler fineliner pens and you can see it from the back (but it doesn't bleed through all the way). - heavier than your typical Bible (I probably won't use it if I travel, but I will definitely be using it at home and around my college campus!)

It has a bunch of monsters, some good ones, some throw-away (as with all of these types of books). The book is less useful as a reference for lore or role playing support. It offers little useful information in monster descriptions. Most of the text in the descriptions I have found to be of very little use. For me, this book is just monster stat references with the occasional flavor support. I would have liked to have smaller illustrations and more of them. If lacking that, at least a physical description of every creature. There are some monsters that just have stat blocks with no further information. Sure I can just google and see what someone else has drawn, or I can draw inspiration from my long history of role playing to make it up, but they devoted a full page to one image from one creature, could they not have just stuck to smaller images and given more space for this stuff? I really didn't need a full page scene with the monster in-action. It would have sufficed to just put a simple illustration for reference. This is still a book that I would not be able to go without (online versions aside), so it is pretty much a must-have for anyone wanting to have physical books for their gaming. I know that some people look for these as fantasy themed art books, some of the art is good, some of it is bad. As an art book, I would give this a 2/5. As a source book for monster stats it's a 3/5.", "review_title": "Gets the job done", "language": "en", "product_category": "book"}

Coming from a positive way of training, she does a lot of forceful methods, and compulsion training which does not create a fun happy environment for your dog. Training is suppose to be fun and build a great bond between human and dog. Shoving a dogs butt into the ground when they don\u2019t want to does not create a fun environment. There are more positive ways to train. In the pictures where she is forcing a dog into position the dog is clearly giving calming signals showing its discomfort. On the pictures where she is shaping behaviors the dogs are having tons of fun, and have good body language. Overall, great book with great ideas, but I would recommend using her positive methods for training, and avoid the compulsion methods.", "review_title": "Great ideas on training!

When it was found, said enemy ran away, thereby making everyone think he was the thief. However, Alan was known as a thief and known to have seen where the jewel was hidden and known to hate his enemy. Surely someone would have put two and two together, especially since the enemy was the son of the woman who lost the jewel! Too pat. Robin Hood was nicely nuanced as someone who had to control a group of people and not just a goody two-shoes. But some of his doings went a bit far, though I liked that he rejected religion.

The images are absolutely beautiful. Specifically The Moon, The Star, The Page of Cups, and The Chariot to name some of my favorites. I know I'll be using this deck often. While the digitally imposed photos of real people in the card can create a closer connection to it, the reality can at times also be distracting. For example, The Page of Swords is a pretty up-close picture of a young man and I just keep thinking of how he looks like someone I went to college with. Another really small thing that bothers me is the Ten of Pentacles has this picture of a sweet grandfather in a silky grey and green robe in the forefront and in the back is a photo of what looks like a modern-day home with a couple holding each other. The image of this grandfather doesn't fit with the image of this modern house. It actually really clashes with the rest of the deck. But the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the card quality is pretty cheap. They are super flimsy cards that will undoubtedly get bent very quickly. Overall, I do love the deck.

There were tons of practice questions for each chapter, but they are very easy to the point that you don\u2019t really need to buy this book. When I took the TEAS, the questions on the actual TEAS were very different. Some reviewers said that the question on the book were similar on the actual TEAS, but they were wrong. I studied the cardiovascular system intensively, and there is no one single question about the heart at all. The English portion on this book is very different on the actual TEAS. In the book, it focuses on grammar and spelling. On the actual TEAS, it is more on \u2018if the sentence is written correctly?\u2019 Overall, I don\u2019t think that this book is worth buying.

I don't know if it is the style by which Amazon stores them or the shipping technique (mine arrived in a huge box with only one small piece of puff plastic) but, they usually arrive damaged. Either the corners are smashed or the decorative pieces of paper are damaged on the cover because, they are loose so easily can become damaged when being banged around in a huge box without any protection. Amazon will often ship books in thick envelopes, either padded or just very very tight envelopes around the book and those books never arrive damaged. I'm assuming the thickness of this style makes it impossible. I ended up ordering 3 and returning them because, they all arrived smashed up.

The book is full of very interesting and and actionable info. The perspective the author takes about actually exposing yourself to more (healthy) bacteria and changing the way we think about what we put in and around our bodies is potentially game-changing. I've implemented a decent amount of advice from this book and have seen nice improvements in my stomach/gut health. Now for the negative. Dr. Axe is INCREDIBLY unrealistic and unhelpful about how people can / should implement his advice. Dr. Axe is ridiculously strict on what you should be eating, even people who were already eating healthy diets will struggle to fully adapt to his recommended diet. He doesn't offer any advice on how to ween off of bad foods and slowly adapt to his diet, he just expects people to go cold turkey and completely change their diet to his recommended diet overnight. That is not sustainable. Sorry, but there's no chance people are going to go from eating fast food and other bad stuff every day to drinking warm homemade bone broth soup every morning, an organic salad for lunch and some other organic meal for dinner washed down with goat's kefir for dinner. Also, the amount of foods that are in the average person's diet that you must eliminate is challenging to say the absolute least. He needs to include a section or at least a few pages on how to gradually implement these things, because like I said, there's no way that everyone reading this book can just make these drastic changes and sustain them. The author also makes the assumption throughout the book that everyone who is reading his book is trying to lose weight. I get that many people today are obese, but not everyone is the same. Everyone has different metabolism and different baseline caloric needs. I personally have a very high metabolism and need 4300 calories per day to maintain my (healthy) weight. Dr. Axe's example meal plans contain like 1500-2000 calories, and he often says not too eat more than one serving of things like meat, fruit, and other foods. So, what exactly am I supposed to eat then? Because I don't need to lose weight and not sure why that is always assumed throughout the book. Another thing, completely changing your diet along with swapping all products in your house and everything else he recommends will be incredibly time consuming and expensive. Especially the diet part. Go to Whole Foods or any other store with his recommended diet products and take note of how expensive goat's kefir is, or organic grass fed steak, or anything else. Not only expensive, but you'll need to dedicate much more time now that you're cooking more and eating less processed, prepared foods. This isn't really a negative, but it's worth noting because some people just won't be able to afford it, and other's might not have the time for it. I wish Dr. Axe talked about these healthier alternatives he suggests and how much better they actually for you. For example, is cow's milk actually SO bad that I need to pay $10 per gallon for goat milk instead of $3 for cow's milk? Do I really need to make homemade Kale chips whenever I want a snack instead of just eating multi-grain chips ?", "review_title": "Full of useful info, but author is incredibly unrealistic about how to implement these things", "language": "en", "product_category": "book"}

The books are in English, but uses words like mum instead of mom, neighbor is spelled neighbour, and so on. These differences stumped my daughter who is an emerging reader. The other things that makes them a little harder to read are terms like candy floss (cotton candy). These make the books a little harder to understand/read, but we just used the differences as a learning opportunity to showcase differences in words and spellings in the USA verses the UK. These are better read together because of those differences. It helps to keep your smartphone nearby too to do a quick google search.

Since converting to Keto we have saved so much money since we don't eat out, but only 1-2 times if that a month!

As a long-time minimalist, I've wanted to read this book for some time. The first portion of the book deals with the philosophy of minimalist living. This was personally my favorite section, and I felt that it did an excellent job of explaining the overall benefits and purpose of the lifestyle to people who are not overly familiar with the subject. As the book went on and introduced the STREAMLINE method, it somewhat lost my attention. This (of course) is most likely due to the fact that I have been a minimalist for many years now, and I'm no longer new to the concept. For newcomers to the lifestyle, having a step by step guide for approaching and addressing the clutter in each area of the house is certainly useful. The author does an excellent job of balancing humor and common sense while addressing some rather sticky subjects. Whether it's family heirlooms, holiday traditions, or the overall effect of our spending habits on families and society, this book has it covered. The beautiful thing about is that it's not some moral or political sermon. I never once found myself feeling as though I was being preached to, or being pressed into accepting the political and social values of the author. The only negative I can find with this book personally, is that some of the information becomes repetitive at certain points. There were a few instances where I found sentences and ideas being reused unnecessarily. It wouldn't be an issue, if the sentences didn't seem almost Word for Word copies. This can be quite jarring for a moment, but the author quickly moves on. All things considered, I found it to be a very stirring and satisfying read. Long-time minimalists will still find helpful ideas and information, and those individuals looking to explore a more minimalist lifestyle will find adequate motivation. Most of all, it serves as a reminder that minimalist living is not about depriving yourself and your family of things that are needed and loved. Nor is it about living a poor, bland, sterile and unsatisfying life. It's quite the opposite, actually.", "review_title": "THE BARE BONES REVIEW", "language": "en", "product_category": "book"}

By bringing attention to girls\u2019 inner experience of gaining and utilizing confidence, the authors not only clearly identify what confidence is comprised of, they guide and instruct the reader on how to cultivate it by challenging the common obstacles of this age. Quite similar to the cognitive-behavioral approach of therapy, this book encourages girls to take action despite unhelpful thinking patterns, to be unafraid of failure, and to challenge the worries that hold so many girls back in a real and direct way. It also provides excellent guidance on how to navigate the often judgmental and provoking world of social media. Presented in a relatable and engaging manner, girls will develop a much deeper understanding of what it means to be themselves and express that confidently. My experience as a psychologist specializing in anxiety has taught me that just as anxiety breeds self-doubt, self-doubt breeds anxiety, and the opposite of both is confidence. I am inspired by what the authors have done in offering such a tremendous guidebook that I am sure tween girls will reference time and time again in their journey to forming a solid, confident self.", "review_title": "A MUST-read for tween girls!", "language": "en", "product_category": "book"}

This biography reads more like a very long resume of his work rather than an examination of the man himself. While I am more aware of the breadth of Marshall's work, I really don't feel I know the man any better. He was married four times, yet there is very little examination of his personal relationships. WHY did these various marriages end? The reader is told when Bart marries a woman, that it's all happy, but then he's suddenly seeing the woman destined to be the next wife, there's a divorce and a re-marriage. WHY? Nothing personal is explored in any depth. His drinking to relieve his constant pain is referenced a few times, but in a \"charming\" way, even after one of his wives is arrested for DUI. Was his alcoholism a factor in the demise of the various marriages? I'm not even sure if his fourth wife was with him when he died. On a technical level, the proof-reader who is thanked so heartily in the last pages of the book needs a refresher course. There are misused commas scattered all over the place. Words are missing from sentences and there are words that are misused. (Learn the difference between \"a while\" and \"awhile\" as one example) There are a lot of poorly constructed sentences as well. I could go on, but I'll just say that the poor writing was distracting and confusing. I've read 16th Century manuscripts with more clarity. I just finished an excellent biography of Barbara La Marr by Sherri Snyder and she wrote a very clear and personal biography with far less information than I'm sure there is about Herbert Marshall. I was expecting a biography of similar quality with this one. I was very disappointed. On a positive note: there are lots of photographs and that is always enjoyable in a biography.
