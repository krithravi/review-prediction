This is a terrific start to a new shifter series - I am very pleased with this author. There are three full length stories in this download.

And the shifters are not as good hiding their secret as they would like to be. The hero's are perfectly suited to each sister. I liked how there was a real sense of community among the shifters and I thought the premise of an artists community well suited to the storyline. The shifters are all ex military and have to chose other occupations to suit their new community.

It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.", "review_title": "Loved Collins...

In a hospital cupboard as we meet our sexy couple Dr. Prescott and nurse extraordinaire Regan.

Our couple's chemistry is off the charts hot with some kink thrown in. They are burning up every surface until they're not. A long held secret explodes and so goes our couple. There's a lot going on in this story...a steamy second-chance romance, a secret baby, the misconceptions between Joel and Regan, and drama, drama, drama. They each think the other caved on their previous relationship. As the baby drama unfolds it's emotional and angsty and the author throws us a curve at the end but this couple is terrific together. The story is set in the US but it appears Regan is British so some of the terms are a mix of both that's a little confusing. Overall this is a sensational read with fabulous characters.

I enjoyed \"Big damn heroes\" and pre-ordered \"Magnificent Nine.\" From the beginning, this book had a different tone & feel from the previous one & the series. As I read it, I didn't remember who wrote these two books but my immediate assumption was that there were different authors for each of them. I was shocked to see that James had written both. The obvious difference is that Nancy Holder co-authored the first one & in this book James was solo. The absence of a female perspective is obvious & is at the heart of why this book bothers me so much. Most of the characters are a shadow of their former selves. Obviously Jayne is at the heart of the book & the two main protagonists, Temperance & Vandal, get the majority of coverage but what really made this book so unpleasant was the disdain for women & violence against them. Firefly (series) & Serenity (movie), like the wild west, were violent but the female characters OWNED their destinies. Not in this book. It felt like this book was written by a man who doesn't respect women. This isn't just about Jayne & the sociopath Vandal being \"done wrong\" by a woman & that is the root of their behavior. Throughout the book is a series of violations against women. The female characters have some agency in the resolution but it's really the men who save the day & rescue them. This book left a terrible taste in my mouth & I am relieved that James isn't writing the next book, \"Generations.\" If he writes additional Firefly books, he needs a female co-author.

Extremely entertaining and found myself staying up late every night as I couldn't put it down.

Story took too long to develop and morphed into a political hit piece of the current administration. Regardless of what side of the aisle you are on, I thought Don Winslow would be smart enough not to incorporate what is being driven down our throats by all mainstream news outlets 24/7.

Did it disturb me? Yes. Did it have characters that stood out? Those are usually reasons that I like a book. However, this one didn't sit well with me. As a woman, the violence was reminiscent of a battered wife, and that I didn't like. So often in these stories, it is romanticized. However, there was nothing romantic about this. The constant behavior followed by a sorry followed by a repeat is unsettling. Especially, as I am drawn to dark romance. Maybe that is what didn't sit well with me. The fact that this didn't feel like fiction and instead felt as if it could have been an episode of Dateline. Hence my dilemma.

Dr. Elijah Hawkins has experienced the worst kind of heartbreak when he and his wife divorced. His perfect marriage fell apart in an instance when his wife decided she no longer wanted to be married. There wasn't any reason other than she needed to be someone else rather than the person she had been all her life. She needed to change her life completely. The only thing that didn't change was her love for their young son. Now Elijah is dealing with heartbreak, trying to figure out what he did wrong so that he can fix it. He's a healer and he wants to heal his broken marriage until he meets the hospital's patient transporter Dorothy Mayhem. Dorothy is a ray of sunshine in his gloomy world. The trouble is that he doesn't know how to date and wooing her isn't easy. Dorothy is special because she is on the autism spectrum. Her life is balanced by her lists, her sense of order, and her unique personality. Just because she moves through life on her own specific terms does not mean she can't be a lover, a partner, a friend, or a parent. She just has to do it at her pace. Elijah loves everything about Dorothy. He's not put off by autism and he's not put off by her peculiar habits. He finds her quirks endearing and values her honesty. Her capacity to love with all of her being makes his world a better place. The ex-wife is starting to see what she lost and wants her husband back. Can Dorothy sacrifice her love for Elijah and his son so that they can rebuild their family. The choice may not be Dorothy's at all. They all have to listen to their hearts and stay true to themselves. They are all a part of the human spectrum. This novel was a not only a beautiful romance but also a beautiful showcase of humanity. I highly recommend reading this Perfectly Adequate by Jewel E. Ann.", "review_title": "This novel was a not only a beautiful romance but also a beautiful showcase of humanity.", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

We tried the Chicken Casserole, which other reviewers had recommended. First of all, it\u2019s better described as a soup or stew as it has a TON of liquid (maybe they have a different idea of casserole in the UK, which is where the author seems to hail from). Also, the cooking time on it is laughably too long. It recommends 30 minutes on the poultry setting (which has a default time of something like 15 minutes). This is with all the ingredients - including sweet potatoes and carrots - in the pot. Since I always try to follow a recipe precisely the first time, I went with it, despite my better judgement. Oh boy, I should have trusted my instincts. The vegetables were completely water logged and basically disintegrated when you stirred the contents of the pot. I mean, I made homemade baby food when my kids were little and I didn\u2019t even cook the vegetables that soft. It was a shame, because it smelled so good. Maybe I\u2019m being too harsh, and should wait to review after trying another recipe or too, but this was just too terrible.

Leah Nash is a newspaper reporter who, due to unfortunate circumstances, has returned to her hometown.

The message is also vague. Its a newspaper article regarding her sister's death. Leah decides to start looking into why the nun left her this article and the more she digs, the more questions it raises. As she continues to chase after answers, it seems that no one is happy that she is looking into it. Will she find what she is looking for? Is the truth worth it in the end?

It basically follows the Ridge family line starting with \"Major\" Ridge. This book is just not about the Trail of Tears. That is not covered until last quarter of the book. This book does give good detail of how the removal came to be and all the ones that were involved in it. It is very good on that standpoint. This should be required studies for all. It is a very bad period of our history that came at the same time the slave issue was being debated very much. It is hard to understand what people were thinking then but it was a very different time and hopefully we have progressed some in America. The reasons I only give it four stars is that much is quoted at length in this book. Much of it could have been summed up in a more concise way to make it more easily understandable. Some of it could have been left out too. Also I think more could have been devoted to the trail. The author seemed to start on good path with it but sort of broke it off suddenly. But still a very good book if you want to gain a good understanding of this terrible episode in American history.", "review_title": "Good History of Cherokee Nation", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

For example, it tells you to have a compelling cover letter, but does not tell you what exactly makes a good cover letter (does not tell you what to include, what not to include, no sample sentences, not what helps in different industries). A number of other books for comparison did help me with those details. This book tells you tells you \"know your value\", but does not provide information on where to find such information. There are web sites that make that information available for various companies and geographic regions. This information could have been included but is not.

The writing offered some powerful, image-evoking descriptions, BUT there were some other, exaggerated descriptions that took me out of the story... as did the large chunks of backstory, including Margaret's history which seemed irrelevant to this (Helen's) tale. I think this work could have benefited from a more limited point of view. Life starts out rather tragically for Helen and doesn't get much better. Her hopeful nature and relationships with Margaret and Peter offer some reprieve to her suffering. I think all the gory details work well to remind the reader that a happy ending would be unrealistic, given the character's plight, trapped in plague-infested London. I thought the author offered the most satisfying ending to be had with the idea that Helen got her revenge from beyond the grave. I enjoyed Margaret's depiction of the fire. \"Will Helen continue chasing her dreams of wealth, or will she find the value of simply being alive?\" Was this question answered either way?

That to me just screams yuck, and I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. Beyond that the entire story kind of leads up to her finally finding out hes a male escort and it was not even an exciting climax. She gets told and is like \"oh I feel so stupid, I should have known.\" Should have known? Who in their right mind would ever expect that? And then all he does is apologize and says he loves her after literally 4 dates of straight lying to her and shes like \"oh he loves me? Hes so sexy I cant resist!\" Like really? Have some self respect! Then shes more appalled that hes never done oral with a client then anything else. This book fell completely flat, honestly wish I could get my money back.

It was quite boring to read, and I almost abandoned it several times, but I am glad I persevered, because I think that it will remain in my memory. It was not a time travel story per se, which was disappointing, because I love immersive time travel-to-the-past novels. This was more like a traveler telling a story...I imagine the audible version would be more enjoyable. The concept of being fully in the present as a time-stopping mechanism is not revelatory. In that sense, it was almost like a fable; I can see how the Mr. Haig would be a successful author of children\u2019s books.", "review_title": "ThIs was an interesting book.", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

The personal opinion parts come out every chapter so far. For example, the author says not to wear big bright logos because they draw attention which makes sense. But then he goes on and on about how he didn\u2019t wear logos because he doesn\u2019t believe in free advertising for companies that aren\u2019t compensating him. I could argue that having logos can help hide you in certain backgrounds. Like if you go to a skater park it helps to be wearing a pair of puffy skate sneakers.

This is becoming annoying as it feels you're reading a brochure. It diminishes the book. 3) Some paragraphs are repeated as highlight sections. Word for word. Which means some text is listed double.", "review_title": "Useful tips, needs good editing", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

An unattached, uncaring man will take easy sex if for nothing else than a release. As Zach says, those women pretend they want a one night stand, but in morning's light they can't face the truth. What they really want is to change the bad boy into the man of their dreams. Not going to happen. That's why he was so intrigued with Paige. Yes, it was evident that she was attracted to him. However, she made him work to get the panties. He had to take her out a few times before she gave in to her desires. Not just that, he wanted to know more about her than just how she acted in bed. Zach and Paige were made for each other. I hated that she had to deceive him, but at least she was looking for the truth.

It is completely ridiculous that a man whose daughter is missing would be assigned to this case, much less this unit, since he would be clearly excluded from any such work. The grisly violence didn't work, it seemed completely gratuitous, as we had no background about why a serial killer became so twisted. The 'suspense\" was scattered and seemed to be all over the place in scenes, especially toward the end, no congruent thought processes. The author seemed to have looked up internet articles on runaway and missing child stats and threw them in ad nauseam and almost verbatim from internet articles. The author tried to throw in stuff to make the teens seem real, like bands names, and etc. but it was a total miss. This book was a complete, laughable mess, I skimmed the entire second half just to finish it, since there was nothing of substance I would have missed.

Who was the mysterious killer? Roland was a smug SOB, but what did he do to deserve being buried alive? Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres.

She blames her mother for their deaths. Why didn't she just go to a hospital like she did for all her other children, that lived. It was evident to me, she didnt want these children, (she thought of them as bastards) and choose to just have them, and let them die. To hide them in a storage unit for years, until its contents were sold for non payment, tells me she is of limited intelligence, or just thought she would never get caught. I found it very hard to have sympathy towards her, and I usually would, but in this case, she was a grown woman who could have told her mother to but out. But she didn't, and chose what she was convicted of. I come from Queens NY, so I wanted to read this story, but I find her actions outrageous.At any time, if what she is saying were true, she could have gone to the police. She claims abuse and rape by her father and brother. The brother is still alive, and refutes her allegations. The babies that died, she didn't want to be with the fathers, the ones that lived, she was living with their fathers. She chose to murder her own infants because they meant nothing to her.

There is no rhyme or reason to it and it often brought me painfully out of the story. I felt as though I were getting mental whiplash. And that was not helped by the fact that a ENTIRE chapter is repeated! All in all I applaud the efforts of the author to tell a story he wanted to tell.

Something I like to do to support my favorite Indy Authors. Dempsey grabs your attention right from the start of 'The Templar Curse'. When Emily Starks is in the storyline, as a reader your in for a pretty decent read, then both Sean and Tommy will face some fierce adversaries and it makes you ignore the predictable formula writing he does. By this I mean, Dempsey seems to always make the bad guys so fierce, invincible, having no equal, ruthless, pay off people to get what ever they want and so unstoppable. An example, when they take the Professor, stab him, then shot him, then dismember him and burn the body in a furnace. Then you have my favorite quote, 'They were a precision instruments, scalpels sent to remove a disease'. Yet they get taken part by a team using tactic's that wasn't up to what the Order of Assassin's used or trained with. Just got too love how the badass bad guys, just put off killing Sean and Tommy, yet they don't blink killing people to leave no loose ends, or even members of the assassin's order. Your waiting for; A) Ms. Starks and Co. to come to the rescue, to free them. B) Alain and his crew make a mistake. C) Tara & Alex will come to their rescue and save the two. D) All of the above E) Combination of B & C Regardless how badly Dempsey hyped up or made the Order of Assassins to be, they get beat pretty simply as both Sean and Tommy escape from them in different ways. It made it totally unrealistic, unbelievable, and killed the story for me. Have to give him props for his writing kept me reading till the end. Since just about every book, has the same theme happening, just recycles them but like the Sean Wyatt character and just wish Dempsey would change it up. He needs to introduce new things to his storylines, it would make for a better reading experience or make it so I can't predict what will happen so easily.

Be warned -- I wish I'd bought the hard copy. The book is fascinating and wide-ranging, but the author always uses Arabic terms, which makes sense since many (most? all?) of them have no direct parallel in English. But there is no glossary, so if you don't happen to remember what an Arabic word refers to, many pages after its first appearance, you're stuck. The only alternative that I can think of is trying the Index -- but on Kindle that means making a note of where you are in the text, then going to the Index to find the term, and going back into the text to try to find the appearance of the term when it's first described. But since the Index of course refers to specific pages in the hard copy version, this will be only a vague indication for an e-reader. I can only wish that the author and publisher had included a glossary in the Kindle version. At this point (I'm about halfway through) I'm not really prepared to go back to the very beginning to compile my own glossary.

That seemed a very modern sort of thing to throw into a story set in the first century. Not only that, but the main male character was NOT a Christian, yet that seemed to cause the heroine no sort of ideological trouble. Part of what the Roman government did not like about first century Christians is that they were different from everyone else. It was dangerous to be a Christian at that time, but our heroine clearly tells a Roman magistrate that she believes Jesus died and rose again the third day, and he barely registers her statement in the dialog. The writing is generally fine, but this plot element should have fired much more conflict than it did. (See Francine Rivers' excellent Mark of the Lion trilogy for the level of internal conflict that should be felt when a Christian woman is attracted to a non-Christian Roman officer as well as a more believable resolution.) I was enjoying the story until the explicit sex, but that threw me out of the time period.

I felt there were times, opportunities within those 6 years that she could of gotten help, collected evidence of the abuse to put a stop to it.

A billionaire, Spencer, meets and educated girl from the hood. Kriss is thoughtful and at times over the top tough. She has sass and much attitude, at times too much for me, but the book is a decent read. Spencer and Kriss are from different worlds but both have families and friends who obviously care about them. They finally get together after Kriss pushes his advances away. Their relationship develops quickly and is filled with moments of jealousy and arguing, and making up. The book ends in a happy ever after. Pros: The book is short but has a plot. Kriss finally isn\u2019t so hard and shows she has fears. Spencer is a decent character. Cons: The grammar is okay, not great. Too wordy, with extra words that bring no substance to the book. A lot of design name dropping, which has become the norm in our culture. The Malcolm scene, her ex, was odd and seemed to be thrown in. The designer that he still employed, but who had a thing for him was unresolved. Spencer\u2019s enemy family was a decent part of the book book sort of fizzled out. The ending and her being you know what could be seen a mile away.

Prince Liam is one hunky dream male lead character and he was one that kept me fascinated with him throughout the entirety of this book. Though he was at first described as a playboy prince, when he met Lucy he is so caring and protective towards her. I love the dynamics between Lucy and Liam. Theirs wasn\u2019t an insta-love romance but there was instant attraction and it was pretty hot! Lucy Rhodes is a sweet heroine and her introduction into the prince\u2019s life came at a time when Lucy\u2019s personal life was imploding. Lucy had this horrible incident happen to her and in order to overcome it, she had to branch out and move on, even though she wanted to try and hide from it all. From the very beginning of the story, when the reader is introduced to Lucy, she has already separated herself from the reality show that has made her and her family famous. She has made her returns to the Hamptons which is where she runs into Liam, who is known as the playboy prince and he is found in a compromising position and Lucy figures all the talk about him is true. Later she is at a party and a face from the past upsets her greatly which makes Lucy wonder if she is doing the right thing in trying to get out and live again after what happened in the past. I felt so bad for her and was rooting for her to overcome what happened to her. She was so traumatized and it made me wonder what all happened to her in the past. So there is that intrigue factor going on. So when Lucy and Liam end up having this one night stand in the bedroom , it makes this a believable situation and the emotions going on between these two reads real and true. Prince Liam is more than what meets the eye. At first he comes off as a huge playboy but there is more than meets the eye with Liam. His charm and kindness along with care for all of those around him ends up endearing the readers towards his character more. As the story builds and steams along, the chemistry between these two is off the charts, but the story is still more than sex. We get to see compassion, care, and genuine concern for the well-being of the other. The plot of the story really starts after a one night stand ends up with an unplanned pregnancy. But there is oh so much more going on. There is something more going on with Prince Liam and that is the real story with the pregnancy the 2nd story line. I loved how both stories ended up consolidating into one. The story is very refreshing and the plot was woven very well. There is intrigue and suspense and there is tons of passion and romance. I really enjoyed this story and highly recommend this story. My Rating: 4.5 stars *****", "review_title": "Jewel of a Romance Read", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

To Madam Butterfly: while BBW is something I don't enjoy, I do understand that for every reader who does not enjoy that genre, you must have twice that many asking for them. I appreciate you honestly labeling your novel BBW, it was my error thinking I could ignore the weight and size references. BTW, I also want to thank you for explaining how authors get paid on Amazon.

Usually, he either leaves the loose ends to the reader's imagination, a perfectly valid literary choice, or he has a few chapters or an epilogue of happily ever after. In this, after the climax, he kind of goes \"oh, by the way\" and wrapped a bunch of stuff up in a single sentence that lacked the detail to make the resolution plausible.

Unfortunately, these men go there with nearly zero understanding of what they are getting themselves into. Many of these men spend years visiting these place, fooled by a fantasy that they have found true love.

As my business grows, learning to be an effective and genuine leader to my employees is much harder than the actual work I do! Meredith Holley's book, The Inclusive Leader's Guide to a Healthy Workplace Culture did two things for me immediately: 1) It gave me a sense of relief because she speaks to exactly what I need-clear, concise and relatable situations that I can easily layer over my own experiences. 2) It gave me tools to begin looking at my business with the goal of creating a stronger, healthier and more welcoming environment for my employees. Meredith Holley does a great job of making the information presentable. She breaks down the idea, provides examples of real life situations, and gives concrete tools to implement the idea. She manages to do this in a manner that makes space for personal reflection without shame. Several times while reading through her book I found myself evaluating myself and how I responded to past situations with employees. Each time I moved to negativity about my choice, the next sentence would be a reassuring nudge that moved me to a new and more useful thought process.

It is a time in America when hatred against Jews is at its peak and people are affected even in this neutral country by being attacked or murdered.

He uses his wit, intelligence, good intention and instinct to perceive danger and help people and himself. This is the way he rescues Hannah and through her gets into solving a mystery which even police had given up. The book has humor, drama, romance and intrigue. Author Lawrence J. Epstein has done his homework well and he describes the events and occurrences of the time in a realistic and believable manner. Looking into negative things- the fact that I would like to raise is that the author worked on making his hero a little too positive and white. I would have liked if the protagonist had some grey shades too. For example he is always into helping people and making them feel at ease. He is not money minded and is ready to pay people extra even though there is no viable source of income.

I love Elle Kennedy's novels. And I love Sarina Bowen's novels. When they co-author a book, I swear sparks fly. After reading their novels Him and Us, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Top Secret! It's classic Kennedy/Bowen magic, this book - the humor, the snarkiness, and of course the heat! Keaton and Luke are very different guys, but damn do they fit together perfectly. I love how the story starts, and how they don't know each other really - they just know each other on the app. It was hilarious to see them snipping at each other in their frat house but then joking around and sexting on the app - they had no idea! I was really curious as to how they were going to find out each other's identity. I think this part of the book was my favorite - the messages between these two guys, neither knowing who the other is. It was very entertaining. Eventually, they do find out who the other is, and this changes the whole course of their relationship. Luke is distrustful of Keaton, and Keaton struggles with merging Luke and his app handle as the same person. It's an adjustment, to say the least. Each guy has a lot to deal with family drama wise. It was a bit frustrating that Luke kept refusing to accept Keaton's help, but I get where he's coming from. His mother and brother don't treat him like family should, and that's made him distrustful of a lot of people. But Keaton eventually starts to gain some of that hard-earned trust, and I loved getting to watch their relationship develop, even though the threat of it falling apart is always there. I absolutely love all of Keaton's random animal facts - they were hilarious! Also, I wish I could see Luke dance in person LOL. I do feel like the ending is a bit rushed, and I wish that some of the side characters had a bit more depth to them, but overall I really enjoyed this novel. I've said it before and I'll say it again, anything these two authors write I will buy right away - it's just an extra bonus when they decide to write together! I hope we have more collaborations in the future ...", "review_title": "Two of my favorite authors back together again??

That she would get a contract to write a book about a string of murders, only to later find out they were committed by her close friend? Sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction. Ann Rule met Ted Bundy when they both worked at a crisis counseling line many years before he became a serial murderer. They developed a close friendship, but became even closer when he was later accused of murder. It was only as the truth of his crimes began to come out that Ann realized that the Ted she thought she knew was all a lie. I think we\u2019d all like to believe that we know the people we\u2019re close to, that we can judge when someone is telling us the truth. The reason Ted Bundy was so prolific and got away with it for so long was that he capitalized on that and masterfully manipulated those around them. It\u2019s hard for anyone to admit being wrong about someone, but it takes a special kind of bravery to write so openly about being deceived by a close friend for so many years. Ann Rule is a masterful true crime writer, but this book truly shines when she reflects on her relationship with Ted Bundy and how even she herself was taken in by his charm. If you read and enjoyed \u201cI\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark\u201d, make \u201cThe Stranger Beside Me\u201d your next true crime read.

It is true to life and very realistic. The character of Swain becomes more likable as the story moves on. With each chapter, the drama of Swain's recent life, the divorce, and the loss of his daughter all unfold. I felt for him in his losses and in his joys that he feared to embrace for so long. The Jones character seems to simply exist as a foil to Swain's character; he is the jerk of a friend that one just can't let go of.

It was everything you want a cozy mystery to be. Not gory, funny, and a cast of memorable characters. The main character is Annabelle Archer, wedding planner. When a demanding mother of the bride ends up murdered on the wedding day (can you imagine) Annabelle starts snooping though everyone tells her to give it up. Things I loved: I loved that this took place in Washington D.C. Apparently the author has visited or lived in and around D.C. She actually describes Georgetown, the Key Bridge, and Chevy Chase in accurate terms. I always get a kick out of books that take place in a city I commute to every day. Annabelle and her sidekicks (her employee Kate and her friend and caterer Richard) are hilarious. Plus all of the food Richard was supposedly making sounded delicious. Too bad no recipes though. Annabelle being a terrible at times amateur sleuth cracked me up. She definitely has a couple of memorable run-ins with clients and a photographer. The book was short enough that you didn't feel like it went on overly long. The writing was concise and the flow was okay throughout. Things I didn't love: Eh to the detective. I know that all cozy's must have a love interest (so it is written) but the detective was a big snooze to me. The next door neighbor was aggravating and not in a cute way. In a, too bad she didn't end up maimed way to me. There is no real why for why Annabelle starts investigating. In most cozy mysteries the first book (so it is written) the main character always is seen as a suspect. The synopsis says that Annabelle's friend Richard is considered one. However, he really isn't and I forget at what percent when the police arrest someone else", "review_title": "things my love", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_ebook_purchase"}

I was also annoyed by the fact that the Hero had a girlfriend he neglected for most of the book -- not a good omen. And there were a number of things that should have been addressed a bit more thoroughly: how the heroine was going to deal with Nick's mother, the grandmother's behavior towards the heroine, etc. Add to all that the fact that it went on and on with nothing happening and no real psychological step forward, and it was a bore of a book.

It is about a teenage girl, Mei Lin Yu, who is named after her grandmother who is one of the founders of their new world. Ten of the richest families left earth which was in decline and set up on a new planet, somewhat pushing the native people to their will. The final ship of Reachers (that helped build the first ten ships) may have never arrived. There are interesting animals, people with some extra abilities, and politics. As Mei is inconveniencing her brother and her parents are always off pursuing their careers elsewhere, she is shipped off to finally meet her grandparents for a couple months before she can hopefully get into the best school (at least if her parents' arrangement for a makeup exam following her missed one due to eye surgery gets her in). Well, she immediately hits it off with a monkey-type of animal and it sleeps at her feet and she talks to it, seemingly getting appropriate looks of compassion back. The people are interesting and she has several discoveries as she tries to connect with the lovely place where they live (not hard to do). The mysteries are beginning to unfold and many suspicions are being worked on. Can she help the local people she is coming to cherish? Is she really just a child who must honor her parents and their wishes? Does she even believe in these supernatural abilities some have claimed exist, including sensing weather patterns and talking to animals? She needs to know more and so do I. Can wait to read more, but I was pleased the way this book ended without a completely abrupt event that left me hanging in the wind too much.

In those series, the plots & characters are gripping, intense, very deeply drawn, clever, and exciting. Tate is a spinoff character from an early Ben Blue story. His role was small but well written. Not so in the first two Tate books. The first in the series is weak and this is worse. There is way too much scenery description, way too much meandering, no clear plot direction, and sloppy construction. Tate just isn't interesting. His character is flat, under developed, and very ordinary. Bradshaw's strength as an author has been his ability to develop colorful, clever, and meaningful main characters. This book just rambles. Very very disappointing. A note: Bradshaw will never clean up his grammar errors. I can't imagine why. But in most of his books, the basic storyline is so terrific, the silly glitches aren't seriously important, just irritating. I recommend new readers read the Ben Blue series first and then start to include the Cain stories, both of which are magnificent. Add a bit of Rubio as well. \"Hickory Jack\", Bradshaw's first novel, is truly an amazing piece of literature.

I never read the book till now when Amazon offered the kindle version for a good price. So I thought I'd give it a try and see how the original novel was changed when converted into a movie. The pace was slower since you have to fit a movie into 90-120 minutes. The movie combined some of the action again to compress it all so I was taken by surprise when certain things didn't happen as in the movie. The book presents much more in terms of things like how Russian submarine crews differed from the American ones which I appreciated.

It's a light, quick, super fun read with likeable characters. Alana has lived a sheltered life on a women's only retreat with her mother who had been a victim of sexual assault. She was taught to fear and mistrust men. Feeling stifled by this lifestyle, Alana wants to break free and experience more of what the world has to offer. She takes a trip to visit her best friend, Kate, who takes her to a Reckless Beat concert. Mitchell, lead guitarist for Reckless Beat, notices Alana in the crowd and is instantly drawn to her. She gets injured, temporarily losing her sight, the collateral damage of an assault meant for Mitch. He feels responsible, so he takes care of Alana, making the most of the opportunity to get close to her. They quickly fall into bed and love with each other. Even though certain things were completely unbelievable, for the most part, I didn't care. It was a page-turner, and I honestly couldn't get enough. Were there inconsistencies with the characters? Yes, definitely. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** For someone so innocent and fearful of men, Alana's behavior with Mitch did not really match up. She was really quick to jump into a sexual relationship with him. Also, it was repeatedly stated that Mitch was drawn to Alana's innocence and the fact that she was not a groupie. But then he treats her like a groupie by having sex with her right in front Blake while he watches and jerks off next to them in bed. This scene definitely seemed out of character for Alana, but it also seemed out of character for Mitch in light of how he saw her. I really enjoyed this story. I loved the fun banter between all the different band members. Some unresolved family issues for Alana could have been explored more in depth but didn't feel like a cliffhanger even though questions remained unanswered.

I found the pacing quite slow in the beginning, whilst overall it was wordy or over written with information and conversations that had no bearing on the story.

I love a strong heroine and not one that is bitter or plays the victim card and sadly that\u2019s how Abbie came across to me right from the beginning and I lost interest. Cameron was a great character and I thought his secret was what saved the story....... This book has a very interesting premise and a great hero with a very unusual secret that is well worth reading.

Only a true master can take a boring, uneventful time in their characters lives, turn it into a novella, and be able to capture me from the very first word. If you love Sarah Maas, then read her books as she meant them to be read, not as you expected them to be written, and trust her to have a reason and to carry it off with her wonderful style. Because her reasons and the final product were worth the read if you want to know what her characters are feeling now that the war is over. Interludes happen in everyone's lives. She has invited you into theirs. Now, that being said... Sarah Maas took the Court of Thorns and Roses, right in the middle of winter, peace in the air along with their version of Christmas, and told us what they all were doing, what they all felt, and what they all hoped for going forward. And kept my interest! That is a masterfully written novel. Not only am I completely floored by her ability to do that, but that she did that while in the middle of her own crisis means even more. I'm so glad your dad is ok, Sarah! I can't wait for the next masterpiece whether we visit the Court of Thorns or the Throne of Glass. Either one will do!

This is a fast-paced, action-packed, suspense romance with really likable characters in Nate and Sophie. The story features a stalker whose identity was obvious from the start but Sophie herself never mentioned him to the police, why not I asked myself? The romance aspect of the story was good but how Sophie went from being an unemployed art teacher to shop owner with an assistant in a few short weeks was unrealistic I thought, even with the help given her by Nate.

Although the actual age of the boys is not revealed anywhere in the story, they are two likable characters who demonstrate the importance of teamwork.This book contains quite a few valuable lessons and as a parent I would recommend it.

In contrast to the first book, this is a bit more slow-paced. This approach was taken in order to give the reader greater insight about the characters and the world they inhabit. This is beneficial to the story as it gives the characters purpose and really puts things in perspective. My qualms with this book are really derived from the lack of intricate twists and turns that are usually prevalent within this genre. Maybe it is because I am well read, but I don't enjoy the prospect of always being several steps ahead. I look forward to those shocking moments, like the Red Wedding in GoT or the Betrayal in the Inheritance series. Overall, this is positive installment in an enticing series.

He is also a man that simply exists, no emotional attachments. He has never felt that way towards anyone. That is until he meets Eden. He is there to help her and finds himself also wanting to protect her. There is an attraction that is undeniable, a pull towards her. Eden is a beautiful, strong-willed, intelligent, and talented woman. She also feels an attraction towards Theo. There is passion and desire between Theo and Eden. There are also conflicted emotions. What does the future hold for Theo and Eden? Read this story to find out. This is an author who knows how to write a story that will have your emotions going up and down the entire time. Theo and Eden are characters that I had empathy for and I also found myself wanting them to find happiness in their lives. This story also has a bit of mystery that will have you asking questions.

I've enjoyed a majority of Ms Chase's stories - these were appealing with their strong females and heroes who couldn't resist them. I was surprised that in books 2 & 3 the gentlemen pursuing the sisters of a duke's sister-in-law didn't give a thought to planning to have the women as mistresses. That was far-fetched - especially considering how close the men were to the duke. It was a huge suspend belief issue. Otherwise, the stories were fast paced, the rhetoric entertaining, dress descriptions too difficult for me to visualize but interesting. Nice sex and seduction scenes & nice action ones too.

She discovers her father is trying to become part of the Collective, a bunch of abnormal criminals. And she discovers the serial killer part of her is not gone forever. This Urban Fantasy is somewhat meandering and Nix goes through a lot of side alleys in her quest for revenge, but what makes this eminently readable and fun are Nix's dog, Abe, and her two guns. That sounds weird when I write it, but yep, its Abe, who has been well-trained with German guard dog commands and constantly is helping Ni by biting into enemy forearms or snuggling up against her leg for comfort, and her two guns--Dinah and Eleanor-- who provide a constant chatter, at times snarky and bloodthirsty, that gives the emotional intimacy I often look for in a partner/love interest. And there is mystery surrounding just who Nix is, what connection Romano's deal with the devil has to Nix, and how she will overcome her pain at losing her son, Bear. He is a constant presence to her throughout this book. I went ahead and jumped into the second book right away because of a cliffhanger regarding the deaths of Nix's family.

Problem is some of the grammar moves beyond the scope of my class. I picked up this book because it covered the past historic, and it was just what I needed. It gives a pretty quick explanation about how this or that piece of grammar is used, and gives some conjugation charts and examples. I've also used it to clarify points that I was confused by in our school textbook. It does also have practice problems with answers you can jump to via hyperlink, so if you're looking for a primary source to learn from this might be sufficient for you. Since I don't use it in that way, I can't really attest to that personally. The reason I drop it to four stars and not five is more an annoying choice for the kindle version. Often they'll put sections of text as images, and I have to click on the image to enlarge it so I can read it. Since it's an image I also can't copy/paste it to my notes, and since to read it I need it that makes referencing anything else on my computer with it a pain.

When I read this was going to be his story of course I was salivating! I really wasn't ever a huge fan of Kane despite being where the earlier series ended up so I was beyond excited to see my favorite, Gage, fall in love. However, I'm very sad to say it wasn't really redeemable after how things ended in the Deadly Beauties original series. I always saw Gage as the hopeless romantic I mean he did so many things trying to obtain Alyssa's love... He doesn't do even a fraction of that for Kimber. He pushes her away, has her the first time at a succubus induced party, he doesn't seem to return her love despite us hearing how he falls in love so deeply, I didn't feel it. (Hearing about his first two loves could have been used to propel his love for Limber but instead it felt like those two loves were greater romances than his love for Kimber.) If that makes sense, I more felt like I was being told he was deeply in love. Kimber was a pretty good character, except I felt embarrassed for her more times than I could count. I'm just not sure C. M. Owens did the best thing by making Gage end up with Kimber, Alyssa's adopted sister. He loved Alyssa and I think if she had ended up with Gage & Kane it would have been better. Honestly this entire book I just felt bad for Kimber like she was an Alyssa stand in. In the book Gage actually says \"We\u2019ve been here for two weeks, and Kimber is more mine than anyone has ever been.\" I'm not sure why that sentence put me off so much, I guess because he really just wanted someone to love him back so badly he'd accept anyone. It felt like for once he wanted someone to love him more than he loved them... Poor Kimber. Ugh. This was not my favorite, I just don't think Gage should have had his own story not with the lengths he went through to get another woman in the other books. But hey that's just my opinion, if you haven't read those then you won't see the same things & you might genuinely enjoy this book. Overall though, it made me a little sad, I never quite felt Kimber was the love of Gage's life despite how the author tried to tell us she was... Idk 2.5 stars for me. One last thing I never minded the \"smirk\" thing in the first series but every other sentence had someone smirking or winking. It became a bit over the top. Still love C. M.
