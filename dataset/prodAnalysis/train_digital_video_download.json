The other 98% of the American population may have reactions to the obvious use of death and destruction in such obviously perverted ways and for seemingly questionable motives. Watch it yourself. See if you too come away wondering just what it is you saw. For me? it was propaganda at the expense of tragedy. Then again, they do it with Holocaust footage. These types of films are better if used to display motives, police work and outcomes. I saw none of that. I put the second star on there due to the cinematography during well-staged interviews. However, I saw no empathy, pathos or sympathy -- just the agenda with a smile, and a glitzy bit of acting.", "review_title": "Gar-ba-ge!", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_video_download"}

The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.", "review_title": "A movie that does many things right, but is not worth watching.", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_video_download"}

In particular, he has to learn there's a lot more to life than money. There are several mini-lessons that the lead character is supposed to learn, and the lessons themselves are in fact good lessons to learn. There's nothing wrong with using a movie format to showcase valid ethical principles. But the writing, acting, directing, storyline, plot devices, dialog, and other aspects of the execution leave a lot to be desired. All aspects of this film betray an amateur level of skill and experience in film-making. That's not a terrible thing, I suppose. If you accept this as an amateur-quality film, you can forgive it for coming across as such. But the whole movie comes across as an extended Christian Facebook meme (probably written in all caps, with a note at the bottom saying something like \"How many of you love God enough to forward this to all your friends?\"), or like one of those contrived emails forwarded (over and over) from your sweet and elderly aunt who wants to remind everyone who deeply she believes Jesus loves them. The lines written for the child, Emily, are meant to be sassy and unexpectedly insightful for a child. She's kind of the all-knowing truth-teller in this story. It's an improbable setup, and unfortunately nothing about this plot device comes across in the least bit believable. They are lines obviously written by an adult, and the acting by the child and others in the scenes simply doesn't work. But again, seen from an amateur perspective, some of that is forgivable. What may bother me most about the movie is that the story arc actually ends up completely undercutting and essentially negating the original moral premise (or what I thought was the original moral premise) by the time the film is over. Rather than concluding with the idea that life can be good and ethical without wealth, it ends up teaching some sort of Prosperity Gospel idea (the idea that \"righteousness\" will be rewarded in measurable worldly gains, i.e. wealth). It turns out that morality of wealth itself is not examined or challenged in this film, despite the many scenes in which wealthy people are painted as superficial, petty, and unethical. The film does not challenge where the wealth came from (oil, in this case, which is dripping in moral dilemmas), and the film does not challenge the idea of so much wealth ending up in so few hands. Wealth itself is an ethical topic worth dissecting, especially in the context of Christianity, which this film does a heavy-handed job of promoting. \"Blessed are the poor,\" said the original Christian, and \"it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" So much for those ideas. The makers of this movie subscribe to a selectively abbreviated version of their own faith tradition.", "review_title": "A contrived, disjointed sermon, in amateur movie format", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_video_download"}

My problem as a viewer is that my father was a WWII U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer in the equivalent position in combat as the character played by William Macy, and who served for 41 years. Macy is a fine actor but is tragically miscast as the Chief of the Boat. I grew up around these men, and they all were rough, tough SOB's, not the sensitive type that Macy plays so well in other movies. Growing up as a Navy brat, I just know far too much about the real Navy of that era to believe things shown in the film, starting with even simple details such as the unkempt facial hair on an Admiral in an opening scene, to the supposed assignment of a young Lieutenant Commander who looks like he is in his 20's as the CO of a combat submarine during war time, without first being an Executive Officer on submarines, where he would have learned his job. This lack of realism continues throughout the film in the dress and grooming of the U.S. Navy sailors shown on the submarine, as well as the lack of discipline displayed. Once you get into the particulars of the plot, things don't get much better and the lack of realism continues to get in the way. You won't notice it if you don't know anything about history or the military, but if you do you may not be able to finish this film. Finally, near the end of the movie, the Chief's refusal to follow a direct order to secure the Enigma Machine from the German U-Boat prior to leaving it would have been tantamount to actual treason in time of war and could have cost thousands of American lives. No real-life Navy Chief would have acted that way, even if he had made an agreement to scuttle the enemy boat. He'd have taken the machine. The scene in the end where a Master Chief Petty Officer has a private meeting with an Admiral is about as realistic as me getting an appointment to see Donald Trump for coffee, and Macy's character visiting a Nazi POW is likewise pretty unrealistic, if his career in the WWII Navy meant anything to him. So, in review, if you dug that historical abomination of a film in 2001 called Pearl Harbor, you will love this movie. If you have ever cracked a history book, or know anything about the U.S. Navy in WWII, you'll hate it. There is a reason this film cost $5 million bucks to make but only sold $64 thousand dollars worth of tickets. They should have spent some of that money on a technical advisor.", "review_title": "This Movie Needed a Technical Advisor!", "language": "en", "product_category": "digital_video_download"}
