I would prefer something with a little adhesive so it would lightly stick to my fingers, but I'm managing so far.

So I online chat with the customer service. The first person was doing her job to check on this order and agreed to issue the refund. And I asked why it takes so long to process, then she transferred me to a so called CONCERN TEAM to talk with me. Can you guess what that person asked me in the beginning? HE asked ME the reason why I finally realized to contact them? YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME. At the end of this conversation, I suggest him not to ask their customer the same question again.

Knowing that and in spite of the fact that I hate using my CPAP machine, it is necessary to treat my sleeping disorder. I have to fight myself nightly to use this machine. It is claustrophobic and feels barbaric to have to force air into my lungs every night that may be dirty and who knows what side effects will be discovered down the road. My insurance company limits the number of hoses and masks to 2 per year. It is really a pain to keep those clean along with the distilled water dispenser. The mask straps must be tight in order to maintain the proper seal, but these straps cut off circulation and cause deep red marks and lines at the back of my neck and chin line. I have avoided mask cleaners because they are expensive and I did not know whether to trust that they would do the job. Okay! Enough Complaining! I finally figured out that I am worth the price that this Lumin CPAP Mask Cleaner sells for and the convenience and safety that it provides. This cleaner uses a high powered germicidal UVC light and a mirrored pull out drawer that kills 99 percent of the harmful bacteria, viruses, fungus, and mold that the tubing and masks can house. This system is used worldwide in surgical centers. It only takes a few seconds to place the mask and hose into the draw and turn it on. It only takes 5 minutes to sanitize the tubing and mask and they can be used safely immediately afterward. Additionally, this cleaner comes with an additional 6-foot tube and mask wipes. I now use this product every night as well as another product that I recently reviewed to eliminate the problems caused by tight straps. My wife also uses a CPAP machine and now uses this cleaner as well. Doing the math, it costs my wife and me each 35 cents a day to ensure that these CPAP masks and hoses are sanitized and this product can also be used to disinfect your toothbrush, electronics, hearing aids, cell phones, or even children\u2019s toys. Considering that our CPAP machines effectively treat my wife and my sleeping disorders, this Lumin CPAP Mask Cleaner makes it safer, less barbaric and more tolerable.

I like this product so much that I only deducted one star for it breaking after three years. My mom used it almost daily and she is not a small woman. It was also installed in her black car, in the heat and cold of Tennessee. The price is so reasonable and the product is so helpful to my mother, I wouldn't mind if they only lasted a year. It is well made and easy to install. You roll down the car window and wrap it around the top frame of your door. then snap it in place. Then close your window and adjust it according to your needs. It is very well made, yet the strap is thin enough to allow the car window to go all the way up. There is no gap that would give a thief easy access to your car. I would highly recommend assisting an elderly person or with anyone with bad balance to install and learn how to use. It needs to be in the correct place to work safely. When adjusting for individual needs, you can easily pull the door closed on yourself or injure your arm/shoulder when using it. Also, it takes some testing to utilize it in the best manner. If it isn't in the right place, it can actually make it harder to get in and out of the car. You also have to adjust the length to allow enough reach without the caddie hitting the driver in the face or obscuring your vision while driving. (You could remove it and place it back each time you needed it. I would recommend marking the spot to reinstall it. You can't get the best use of the product if it's not in the correct spot). When installed correctly, you actually use the top of the door frame to pull yourself in an upward motion when exiting your car. It is this pulling upward motion that allows you to lift or hold yourself without slamming the door on yourself. When entering your car, you can steady yourself with a bit more fluid movement as you are using it to close your door as well. Once it is in place and you have gotten used to the body mechanics of using it, you will find it to be a tool that you can't live without. My mom may not be able to continue to drive if she didn't have the Stander Car Caddie.", "review_title": "Next best thing to a helping hand.", "language": "en", "product_category": "drugstore"}

I had been consistently taking ibuprofen and icing my knee daily. After reading the glowing reviews about this collagen, I decided to give it a try. Within one day, yes one day, I realized that my knee was not hurting! I\u2019m back to taking my high impact cardio classes & not experiencing pain afterwards. I am so thrilled! I\u2019ve told my family, friends, anyone who mentions pain or stiffness, about this product! I\u2019m not sure what makes this collagen different from the others, but it\u2019s done wonders for me!

I mean - let's face it.....it's not going to be the most comfortable thing. The one big problem I have with these masks is that they do NOT fit snugly over the nose/mouth. The ear hoops are so long and so elasticated that if you just hook them around your ears as intended, you will be basically reaping ZERO reward from wearing them. They flap about on your face and filter NO air. The way *I* solved this is to clip the ear hoops on the back of my head with my hair butterfly clip. It's not perfect....but it actually does smush the mask against your face enough to have you *actually* breathing THROUGH it, as opposed to AROUND it. I also have the added bonus of the fact that it keeps my hair tied back as well. They do smell of vinegar - but if you bought a citric-acid-and-zinc-impregnated facemask and expected it to not have any odor, I have no sympathy for you.

I would rather go without a meal than miss my daily Curcumin as this has been a life changer for me. I can take acetaminophen, but that does NOTHING for inflammation. Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory and for a person who has severe allergies to Ibuprofen, it is an absolute must have to help with inflammation. Interestingly, since I began taking curcumin daily, I rarely have headaches anymore either. I used to get a bad headache at least once every couple weeks, not anymore, I almost never get them. I don't know the correlation, but it must have to do with inflammation. If you have joint pain for any reason at all, take Curcumin, you won't know how you lived without it. No chemicals, totally natural, and it is good for you. I tell EVERYONE I know about this product because it has made such a big difference in my life and how my body feels on a daily basis.

It works for that so far. I have yet to use it on a lot of short dog hair. I bought this one since it was made of wood and not plastic. It's getting three stars for materials and packaging. Unfortunately, the chrome looking piece is definitely plastic (more likely to break) and the materials don't look as nice as they do in the picture. The packaging was RIDICULOUS. It came in a plastic padded envelope INSIDE Amazon's plastic padded envelope. Inside the two envelopes, each piece was wrapped in plastic... It was so wasteful.

I decided to try out reusable pads because I hate regular pads and I figured these would better for the environment. I chose this brand based on other reviews and the black cover, because, well, I thought it would hide the blood easier. They work perfectly at the absorption aspect. They feel soft and breathable. Regular pads often make me itchy. They are easy to clean. I soaked them in cold water and hydrogen peroxide the first time. The next time, I just threw them in the washing machine with oxiclean and regular detergent. I dry them hanging like I do my bras and underwear. The one criticism that I have is that they don\u2019t adhere as well as a regular pad, especially the overnight one. I solved this problem by using strips of double sided fabric tape to adhere to my underwear. It works perfectly. I would say give them a try.

Mostly just felt spongy which is not really want you want in athletic shoes. They are quite thick so might need a larger shoe to accommodate them. The \"massage\" nodules are distracting and gimmicky and not having them would be an improvement imo. The broad size range makes the placement of the arch support a bit hit or miss. I was cutting then down for 9.5 mens and I'm not sure the placement was all that great. The size range does have the advantage of better fitting shoes in the middle of the range with a broad toe box.

One of the bottles were slightly frozen in a fridge and it actually ended up just falling to pieces because it couldn't handle the expansion of the frozen water. I understand this is common with glass containers but regardless it was barely frozen and broke on its own. 3. The interior design of the caps are really bad and tough to clean as well. They have this metallic smell to them that seems to never go away. thankfully it doesnt rub off on the bottle but its still worrying to be sipping from a bottle that has a metallic smelling cap.

To its defense, my face gets very dry, all year round lol. The smell is not bad, I find it pretty pleasant. The consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too light but it absorbs quickly once applied to skin so rub away! It's a nice size. If you don't need much cream on your skin, this will easily last you two months. Sadly mine is already coming to an end after a month and one week.

I have been exercising regularly for a few years now and I decided to treat myself to this item as a birthday present: BIG MISTAKE. When I work out, I exercise vigorously. I go to the gym to get a good, intense workout in and usually come out sweating. I do both cardio and weights, but this device runs into the most problems when it comes to cardio. The heart rate tracker literally cannot read through my sweat. Yes you read that correctly - A FITNESS TRACKER CANNOT READ YOUR HEART RATE THROUGH SWEAT. How ironic. My heart rate will jump (during intense, steady-state cardio) from 165 to 110 to a blank screen (as you can see in the photo attached) to 150, then 98, etc. I contacted Fitbit customer service and was sent a replacement device. It also didn't work. Then, they sent me a SECOND replacement device. It also fails to accurately track my fitness stats. Given that this is the third device that has failed to record my stats, it clearly is their technology that is faulty. They refuse to reimburse me for their faulty product. If you actually care about exercising and want to do so with anything more than moderate intensity, don't even waste your money on this device. I'd recommend spending the extra $100-$300 on a Polar Watch or Apple Watch to get a product that will actually work for years at a time.

I bought these earplugs for reading on the train and long evenings at rehearsal. I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity.

I've been getting a better nights sleep (not sure if it due to taking this though). I've noticed some gains in my workouts. I feel stronger and my endurance on the \"machine\" is increasing constantly. I've been concentrating on \"core\" exercises and I'm slowly getting my stomach back to where I want it. I've lost almost 20 pounds and the majority of it has come off since taking the Test booster. What I like best about it is the natural ingredients and the gel caps. They aren't too big and I'm able to take them all at once. Personally I take mine after my workout with my breakfast (as directed to take with a meal). I've read that some people take their test boost on an empty stomach, etc, etc...As for libido, I never really had a problem with my libido or my stamina in bed.

We have discovered that it is best to step on, balance yourself as best as you can and dont look down to see if the green light indicator is lit. You just have to step back and off. If you are lucky, the green light will be lit. If you look down while in the process of weighing yourself, it will either go blank, or not give you an accurate reading.

If you're not profoundly hard of hearing, the lowest volume setting might still be a little high. Something very high pitched or high pitched and percussive, will come across as static through the ear piece, like jangling your keys. On the strong background noise reduction setting, static is minimized. Because the over the ear hook is not very secure, you almost have to use two hands to make adjustments to the controls. Pros: they generally work, and for not much money. The highs sound a bit brittle if the volume is up, but, I just turn the volume down. If you're getting a squealing sound, that is feedback, and you need to push the ear cup further into the ear canal so it seals. Are they as good as my $1500 per ear customs?

I had to attach two small mirrors to the handles so as to watch for approaching cars from the rear.

All of which were quality products. However, this particular supplement has been a huge disappointment in terms of quality control. When mixed with other pre-workout powders or even on its own, Evlution Pump Mode does not fully dissolve in nearly any practical amount of water. I have mixed it into both 8 oz and 16 oz containers respectfully and in neither case had Evl's product completely dissolved, but instead left a very off putting mush of non-dissolved particles on-top of the liquid in the glass/shaker that I was drinking out of. Moving onto the taste of the product: I don't really have much to say. I had bought the unflavored version so I had expected it to taste poorly due to it just being pure ingredients (and trust me, it did taste poorly). I am still giving this product three stars because despite its flaws, it does continue to give me solid pumps in the gym which is exactly what it is intended to do.

It seems like maybe one in 20 or so is a knock off and if you get them it's horrible I don't plan to risk it again. Furthermore for my son to break out in such a way it worries me of what these diapers contain I hope they don't have some harmful chemical on them.

It's bigger than my last one but it is pretty powerful! .... As people say, you can use it for many different reasons but mainly, it is powerful enough to vibrate your whole body! I like to use it on the back of my neck, as I have daily tightness there and stress buildup. It definitely relaxes you. The reason though that I give it a 4 is because (as others have mentioned) the buttons cannot be easily located (especially at night or if you close the lights) ... You have to fumble around and try to figure it out, otherwise, you can see the ridges of the 3 buttons, when you turn on the lights. Charging is easy enough, as it comes with a wire and you just plug it in for a few hours and it's ready to go again! I only use it for a few minutes at a time, to loosen muscles so I haven't calculated how long it lasts altogether but I have owned it for weeks now and only charged it 2 times so far, so I can clearly say, it's goes a long way and still keeps the strength. The downfall, is that when it dies, it literally just stops working and doesn't slow down first so you know to charge it soon... One second it's working and the next, it stops suddenly! That might be bad for someone who wants a heads up! There's a read light that comes on, once you have turned on the main button and they stay lit, for as long as you have the massager on. It's true that the red light is NOT aligned properly with the buttons and it looks pretty sloppy that way but it's just a small little issue and doesn't really bother me. Not sure why people would want to travel with this, it's pretty big and does indefinitely look like a sexual pleasurable toy so I wouldn't want to be caught at an airport security, having to open my bags up and pulling this out of my suitcase ... I would DIE! I usually travel with a carry-on or handbag and they always inspect those, upon your security check. Wouldn't be convenient to travel, unless you a) don't care about getting caught with it b)you have checked-in luggage and won't get caught .... or for those who don't travel, and don't care either way! lol...Overall, I would say for anything under $40 bucks, this seems legit and worth the money to invest in. It has a sturdy and solid build and the head does not rotate (just vibrates) so I think it will last a very long time. I'm also happy with the overall velvety smooth finish, it glides on my skin and feels very comfortable and soft!

If you are someone who likes white noise while you sleep, this is the device for you. It is small, portable, well-made, has a wide range of volumes, and fairly easy to operate. This device fits in your hand and can easily be packed for trips. It remembers whatever setting it was last on, so you don't have to readjust it every time you unplug it and plug it back in. The construction seems solid and put together with the intention to last; this is not a cheap feeling product. The sound output can go from quite quiet to almost too loud, so virtually everyone should be able to find the setting that is right for them. Initial setup is a bit of a hassle, what with going through every one of the noises, but once you find the one you like, you can just stick with it forever. There is a 60 minute option on the device, which shuts it off after an hour, but I only ever use the continuous sound with the simple on/off button. The 60 minute option does work, however, as I've tested it just to see. What I really like about the continuous sound from this device is that it never loops or has any pauses while it restarts--it's just uninterrupted white noise going endlessly. It really is great. While you might think 50 bucks is a lot for something that just makes a repetitive noise, you sleep every single day. I've had this for several years now and it is still going strong, so that means I'm paying only a penny or three a day to help ensure a good night's sleep. I'd call that a solid investment.

These plugs may work for others so this is solely my opinion due to what I prefer. It's really not about the product itself because others may love it. They came packaged nice. As I removed them I noticed right away that they were a play-dough or clay-molding type consistency. From reading others reviews I only used one and split that in half because I have small ear canals. I molded them per the package instructions and put them in my ears. I did not like the residue that they left on my fingers from molding them to fit my ear and putting them in and the thought of that being in my ears bothered me, but I wanted to give them a try. They went in easily and formed to my canal perfectly. I can only compare them to the foam earplugs that I normally wear which are the green ones that look like a torpedo - they have a little extra rim on the end that I use to mold to the outer area of the ear canal to help block the sound. I was not able to do that with this product because it was too pliable and spread too thin. I found them to be the same comfort level as a foam earplug overnight. I sleep with an extremely heavy snorer and found that they did not work as good as my foam plugs to muffle the snoring all night. I woke several times and had difficulty going back to sleep because it just didn't quite block out enough decibels for me. As I removed them in the morning, I used the twist motion so that it would not suck at my eardrums when I removed them and that worked fine. It felt like they left behind a residue in my ear, although that could have been all in my head because of when I formed them the night before and the residue left on my fingers. Also it really wouldn't be a big deal if there was a little residue because it would be cleaned out with the morning shower anyway. Just not for me - others may try them and love them.

But the velcro sticking to itself and the straps tangling and adjusting the backstrap up or down is frustrating. Not good for customer satisfaction. I think longer straps would help a lot, but that could be a problem in public under a shirt. However, they could give that option or design a detatchable strap extension. And the people they use to model it are young, slim, and athletic. How realistic is that.! That's not their customer base. I'm 85 years old, 6 feet and 190 pounds. If they'd create a clear, detailed video tutorial it would pay them huge profits with positive reviews. ONE DAY LATER AND I'M EDITING THIS....

There is another review for this product on Amazon that has a total rating of 2 stars for the same item. In any case, I\u2019ve used this product for about a week now and have formulated some pros and cons. I did not buy this product to help prevent snoring. I bought it because I sleep with my mouth open. I can\u2019t wear my mouth guard at night anymore because I just got adult braces. The mouth guard prevented me from opening my mouth while I slept. With my TMJ issues, I need to have my jaw shut while I sleep to prevent further strain on my jaw muscles. - This product is well made. Material is fairly sturdy and looks like it will last awhile. - It smells like chemicals. It\u2019s not horrible and doesn\u2019t prevent me from sleeping. However, I can see that some people would be bothered by it and may be very sensitive to the smell. It does dissipate with time but after a week I can still smell it. It may always linger even as time passes. - The holes designed to position your ears in is very uncomfortable. I can\u2019t use it. As a result, the chin strap doesn\u2019t always stay securely on during the night. - The material is very heavy and there is a lot of it. It\u2019s so heavy in fact, and has so much cloth, that I get super hot and sweat quite a bit during the night while wearing it. It wakes me up at night and my sleep is restless. This product is not for me. I found another chin strap on Amazon that is lighter weight, has less cloth and the material is breathable.

I use a tiny spatula, well it really is the flat side of a plastic orange peeler :) It has to be on dry dentures, I just blot mine off if there is any moisture still on them. I also use a paper towel and dry off my gums where the dentures touch. I hold them in tight and don't eat or drink for half an hour. Good to go. If for what ever reason I had too much and feel leakage in the back I just use a tissue and wipe it off. I also found that if I leave them in overnight (24 hrs) its much easier to clean off the dentures and my mouth.

The unstained wood goes with any decor, and looks nice sitting on a bookshelf, or table. For $20, this is a great buy, one that would make a nice gift for anyone who is just starting to their collection of essential oils. Thank you for a great product!

I also have Doterra brand oils, which are often way more expensive than these, so I decided to give a different brand a try. These just aren't as good of quality, which should be expected from a cheaper brand of oils. They work great for aromatherapy. I wouldn't use them for topical use, but they all have a nice smell, so they will be mainly used in my diffuser which is what they said their product should be used for.

It still moves and will come off through the night sometimes but will usually make it to the morning. As far as the actual product, it is very soft. The velcro strap is wide enough that the mask keeps its shape and it is soft enough that makes it very comfortable on your head. I will add that it does not grab hair either, well at least mine not sure with someone that has long hair. The concave covering over the eyes is great. If you are on your back, you don't feel anything touching your eye. For the side sleeper, it is very flexible and soft that it is also comfortable when you got your face buried in the pillow. I didn't buy this for blackout feature of light but it does work pretty good. I did take a nap in the middle of the day last week and no light came through. The nose cut out helps with this compared to other masks. I purchased this to protect my right eye. I developed a lazy eye lid that opens on it's own when I sleep and being a side / stomach sleeper, this causes the sheets to scratch my eye and then for days I look like I have pink eye and it is scratchy and irritated. This mask has eliminated that problem and since I have been wearing it, my eye has been in great shape. I didn't give this review 4 stars because it still isn't \"perfect\" for side / stomach sleepers and honestly I don't think I will ever find one, but this one is the best I have tried so far.", "review_title": "Good for side / stomach sleepers", "language": "en", "product_category": "drugstore"}

So far it does great at detangling and has a pleasant smell that isn't too strong. I like the fact that the ingredients are mild and not full of synthetic harsh chemicals, but the container arrived with the cap halfway unscrewed and about a fourth of the product was spilled into the bag that it came in. Really wish whoever shipped this would have taken the time to make sure that the cap was screwed on tightly, and that the squirt nozzle was securely locked and taped so that it didn't unlock during shipment. This would have been 5 stars, but losing a quarter of the product means I lost that money and dumped it in the garbage. I would have sent it back (and probably should have), but for the price and the fact that we were out of conditioner at home, made me come to the conclusion to at least try it out.

Let me just say that this is way more comfortable than the cups in the combo pack. I like that the stem is cylindrical and short as opposed to long and flat. I also like that the seam is along the rim and not running down the sides of the cup. The cup is much softer and the rim is just firm enough to easily pop open. The upside to having a softer cup is that 1) you really don\u2019t feel it, and 2) it lessens the bathroom issue of not being able to potty properly (or completely), because the cup is pushing on your bladder. I\u2019ve also figured out the best positioning for me, which helps too. The downside to having a softer cup, specifically in the base, is that you have to work a little more when pushing up the cup. Other that that, I really like the cup. It does closely resemble the Blossom Cup for any one who has tried that one, but not sure how it truly compares in functionality. It\u2019s a very good price for what you get in the box. I appreciate Pixie Cup giving me the opportunity to test and review their product.", "review_title": "This one is better, for me.", "language": "en", "product_category": "drugstore"}

It has a quality feel that gives me the notion that it may last and it is waterproof--a feature I have not yet tested..

I got the berries and cream flavor. It was good in the beginning when I started to chew, but the more I chewed and it dissolved I started to get a bad taste that continued on to become a bad aftertaste. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. It\u2019s not a bitter taste but it\u2019s certainly not a pleasant taste. Another thing I didn\u2019t like is that each chew has 4 grams of carbs. I need 1500 mg of calcium per day due to Bariatric surgery, so I would be consuming 12 grams of carbs per day. I\u2019m trying to follow a Keto way of eating and would prefer it not to have so many carbs just for a supplement. It has corn syrup and sugar, and then they added Splenda. I guess the aftertaste would be worse if those ingredients weren\u2019t there. I do applaud them for avoiding aspartame. I do like the fact that they used calcium citrate instead of carbonate. I also like the fact that one chew is 500 mg. It has some Vitamin K2 in it as well which is good. I\u2019ll continue to take these until I find a reasonable replacement. I\u2019ll just have to have something ready to eat immediately after these chews to hide the aftertaste. I\u2019ve always had very sensitive taste buds.

However, it is made of a different material than every other kinesiology tape that I have used or seen. Whereas the others have a cotton-like appearance, this is made of a material like spandex / lycra - think of the shiny bike shorts from the 80's. This causes it to be significantly stretchier than the other tapes I have used, which means that the performance could be different since it will move more easily with the skin and not pull the skin away from the muscle as strongly.

Nothing in this world is more disappointing to a child than opening a toy requiring batteries and none are available. I found these batteries to be every bit as reliable and long lasting as the double priced batteries (you know those of which I speak) and many of them are still going in spite of high usage over the last few days. I am certainly not disappointed nor are my grandchildren. None of the many batteries were found dead or leaking and the packaging lends itself well to storing unused batteries. These come package in four packs and enclosed in a sturdy cardboard container which will store flat in any drawer while keeping unused batteries organized and easily found. I will certainly be ordering batteries from Amazon in mass rather than paying twice or three times the price elsewhere.", "review_title": "super price on quality batteries. no regrets here...", "language": "en", "product_category": "drugstore"}

Covered in smooth, body-safe silicone, rechargeable, waterproof, and shaped perfectly to stimulate both internally and externally with ease, this vibrator is more impressive than it seems at first glance. It really does pulsate, and not in an overly-aggressive, springy way. Instead, weighted balls inside the toy pulse back and forth in a rhythm that you can adjust to move faster to your liking. The toy also vibrates intensely, so you can use the external arm to stimulate your clit simultaneously. Although truthfully, the vibration is a definitely a bit buzzy and while the toy is advertised as wearable (meaning you should theoretically be able to achieve dual stimulation hands-free), I did find that the clitoral arm was positioned a little off the mark, and the toy was much more effective if I held it in place. When I did that, however, it worked beautifully, thrusting back and forth internally as sensations rose to delicious levels. The toy comes with a handy remote control, which I did use to adjust my initial chosen intensity, but since my hand was still on the toy throughout use, I admittedly did not utilize it nearly as often as I simply cycled through the different patterns manually on the toy. But during partner play, the remote is a super handy, user-friendly tool that I'm glad the company included. One last thing I have to mention: this toy heats up. Seriously. Double tapping the on/off button activates the heating feature, and upon doing so, I immediately felt the toy getting warm (but not too hot) in my hand. This added stimulation feels amazing and is the only time I haven't been concerned when a toy started to get hot while I was using it. Don't worry, it's totally safe, and totally worth testing out. Bottom Line: This toy is fantastic. It contains the same features as popular high-end toys at the same level of effectiveness for less than a quarter of the price. It's a game changer and I'll definitely be keeping it by my bed for regular use. Can't wait to try the next toy this company has to offer! (side note: If you noticed that the toy is shaped similar to a prostate massager, you're absolutely right. It can be used on the male prostate just as effectively, making it one of the first pulsating prostate toys on the market.

She would not eat it and I did not even realize that it was supposed to be refrigerated after you open that. Or a girl that she would not eat it. I contacted the seller asking if I could return the unopened tub since I got two tubs and I believe they made a fair offer to return the money for one tub and help me just throw out the rest of it. So I supposed to get half of the purchase price back. Figured that was fair enough. Problem is when they refunded money they only refunded a quarter of the purchase price instead of half.
