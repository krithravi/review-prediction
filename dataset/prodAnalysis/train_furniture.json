This chair caused more pain in my lower back and now have to find a new chair and sell this one. It is very comfortable and has everything it states if you are the right size person. There are some key issues to note. The seat is extremely long so if you have short legs it becomes extremely uncomfortable and cuts off circulation, because the seat is so long it makes you want to scoot forward to feel comfortable with your legs/knees but this causes you to lean back father than anticipated, because you are forced to lean back more even with the chair straight up, your arms slide back with you and away from your desk, and because you have to do this you end up wanting to scoot the chair forward but you can't because the arm rests are positioned to far forward and hit your desk. The chair is meant for a taller person and thats coming from someone who is 5'11 with normal proportions. If you are taller than that then this is a great chair!

Babies fall and babies bump their heads. She spends a lot of time in our living room so I ordered this rug pad 8 months ago. Before I reviewed this rug pad, I wanted to use it for a significant amount of time. First, I am shocked by any review that would call this \"plush\". This will not soften your rug, it is INCREDIBLY hard and tough. Is my rug thicker now? Kind of. Is it any less hard when I'm walking? No. Is it less hard when my baby falls? To be honest, not really. This will not make your rug feel nicer or any softer. It will just make it slightly thicker. That, alone, was a little unfortunate. I kept telling myself, \"well at least it's protecting the hard wood floor\". My baby will fling her sippy cups around and although they don't leak much, some water will spill out. More often, my friend will spill a beer on the rug. We clean the rug but felt better about having this rubber backing. Like idiots, after something spilled, I don't know how many times we actually checked to make sure the pad caught the liquid. We probably had about four spills until we checked and we were SHOCKED to find that the liquid seeped through my rug and RIGHT THROUGH THE RUG PAD. What on earth is this for, then? It doesn't soften the rug when you're sitting or crawling on it. It doesn't protect my baby when she bumps her head (no more than the rug would without this pad) and it doesn't protect my floor! I paid decent money for this and it was a complete waste. I'm so sorry I bought this rug pad. I'm giving it two stars because it really doesn't slip.

It's a nice looking stand and perfect for holding our components under our TV which is mounted on the wall. Unfortunately, both wood pieces arrived with multiple scratches and dings in them.

The wood pieces seemed to be well packaged in the first box, but I was obviously paying more attention to that when the second one arrived. They were both wrapped in a padded sleeve and well secured in the box. The problem is that the padding isn't thick enough on the bottom side and since everything else in the box is rigid, the wood was being damaged through the padded sleeves. And, just to add insult to injury, since they package the wood pieces front side down, that's the only side that gets damaged; the back sides are unblemished. There were still scratches and nicks in the second set, but they were in better shape than the first ones, so I swapped those out and will return the second unit with the first set of wood pieces. One other note is that the unit is seemingly much deeper than necessary for most components, so it sticks out farther from the wall than I'd like, but that's not a big deal.", "review_title": "Nice Component Stand - Wood Pieces Damaged Due to the Way They're Packaged", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

It did NOT expand to 12 inches! It was 10\" on all sides though,not like some people's reviews that said it was uneven all around,or received moldy or smelly beds. Mine is clean as shown in the picture and I didn't notice any strong smells,just a faint odor that went away after a day or two. I took a picture after it stopped expanding,and while the covering was slightly loose in one area,the bed looks pretty. I have back problems and this mattress has NOT helped. I purposely waited to write this review after sleeping on it for a week. One review said the bed felt soft and firm at the same time and I wondered how could that be? I don't know but she was right! If you like a firm mattress then you'll probably like this,though some said it gets softer as time goes on. I personally have been having back pain every morning so I will be adding a soft foam topper to put over it!

I read from one review that a guy called Amazon and they helped him so I gave it a shot! I explained that I didn't want to return the bed, but since I was paying for a 12\" bed and my bed is only 10\" that I should get a discount and that's what they did!

Ashley furniture seems to have a decent reputation, and their retail presence suggests to me that they still stand behind their products, to an extent at least. I wanted a long, traditionally puffy and comfortable plush sofa, so I ended up going with this one. The sofa comes well-packaged, but perhaps not well enough to endure mishandling by shippers - luckily there was none in this case. I was surprised initially by how light it is. It's huge, but lighter than its bulk would suggest. This could be a good thing or a bad thing. I will certainly update my review with any added observations on long-term durability. On another durability note, I was not overly pleased with the feet that come with the sofa, and must be installed without predrilled holes. The feet are somewhat light and flimsy plastic, so I am not sure they will hold up over a long time. I'm sure they can be replaced easily, so I'm not overly worried, but I wish they had included better-made and more solid feet. The screws were also extremely hard to drive into the wood base (not joking, I had to put together a lot of pieces with no predrilled holes as part of a recent move, but these four screws were definitely the most difficult to drive!). They have very shallow Phillips heads which easily come loose without applying an absolutely insane amount of pressure. Not a pleasant experience. Now that the moving and setup is over, however, the sofa is a very pleasant piece of the living room! It's the right height, and sufficiently large for plenty of comfortable room for several people. The back and armrests are extremely comfortable. Surprisingly, the cushions are a little less so, as the foam is very, very firm, at least initially. This is probably a good thing, and speaks to better long-term comfort, but you may find them slightly uncomfortable at first. Overall, you get what you pay for, especially with living room furniture. I do believe this is a good choice for the money, and a good value overall. It is a large and comfortable plush sofa that should hold up well over time, and will probably grow more comfortable as the seat cushions break in. My only concerns are with the durability of construction, given the lighter than expected weight, and the flimsiness of the feet. But I expect the worry is unfounded.

Materials are high quality and the assembly is easy and straight forward if you've ever put a chair together before. One complaint I've seen is that the arm rest are too firm. Unless you consistently keep the points of your elbows on the armrest they are fine. The lumbar support is a great feature to have and more chairs should include this. The seat does use firm foam but if you are sitting for extended periods of time this is something you will come to appreciate. It does break in slightly over time but don't expect it to be a night and day difference from day 1. Overall I expect this will be a chair that holds up very well and will last. The included pillows are a nice feature, I find myself using the headrest pillow on a regular basis. The lumbar pillow though I only use when reclining to help fill the gap at the base of my back. While reclining I should add that the chair is solid and I've never felt like it was going to tip over. The ability to lock the tilt mechanism while tilted back in something I wish my other chairs would've had. One thing I hope that is changed in future iterations would be the ability to move the built in lumbar support higher or lower depending on your height. I'm 6'2 200lbs and the chairs fits perfectly but I can see how a taller or shorter person might have issues with the lumbar location. Lastly I did switch out the wheels for larger roller blade style wheel to allow the chair to roll easier on carpet. The included casters are nice and higher quality than most but will still struggle to roll on thicker carpet.

Please open the box, and assemble the shelf, and if you're missing any pieces, we're happy to send you free replacements. I figured, they must know their packaging sucks. So per their disclaimer, I took a chance, and hauled them all to my unit and away I went - opening each box, carefully keeping every single cardboard and plastic wrap, for fear that I'd have to return something. As I went through each box, I realized that all the plastic pieces I was finding all broken up and all over the ground were just the \"protectors\" between each shelf and corners of the boxes. They had nothing to do with the actual shelf! By the end of the day, I had every single shelf assembled, every piece of hardware and all! I'm very happy with the shelves, would buy again! I'm giving them four stars instead of five, because the packaging is so bad. I'm glad they had their disclaimer on the outside of the box, without that, I would've immediately turned around and returned them!", "review_title": "Great Shelves, Don't Let the Packaging Scare You!", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

I have to either ship a 70 lb bulky item back myself or arrange for a freight carrier with amazon that gave me a 4 hour window which requires me to be home. I don\u2019t get my refund until this is completed. This should just be thrown out and save everyone an inconvenience so i could either A. Order again. Or B. Get my refund.

Here is a list of things I was disappointed about the chair. First of all, the build quality. The arm rests are held together by two screws, one at the top and one at the bottom. Not a very good design. I always feel like I'm going to break the arm rests whenever I put my arms on them. It's very wobbly no matter how hard I tighten the screws. What's worse is, if you break the threading in one of the screw holes, it's over, the arm rest won't stay. The back is held to the seat by a thin metal plate with 3 screws. Also not a very good design. I want to lean back and the only thing preventing me from falling is 3 screws and a thin metal piece. I added a picture of the three screws connecting the small tab of metal to the seat. The foot rest also looks like it's going to break by the way it bends when I put my feet on it. The chair is slightly tilted to one side. It's too noticeable to let it pass. The handle for letting me recline is way to far for me to reach. I have to get out of my chair to pull the handle. The arm rests are way too wide and too tall for me to comfortably place my arms. Also, it smelled of oil, but it went away. Leaning back wasn't as comfortable as I thought. I always feel like I'm sliding out of the chair. But that's without the footrest. With it it's fine. I would have let this chair slide for its price had it not been for it's build quality. Had it been made a lot better, I would have said it was worth your money. Unfortunately, it could have been a lot better. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't a completely awful chair. The main reason I bought it was because it had a headrest. Aside from the arm rests and the slight tilting, the feeling of sitting in it wasn't too bad. If you know you're not going to break this chair and don't care too much about where you place your arms, you may find it comfortable. But in the end, I would recommend something else.", "review_title": "Poor Build Quality Left Me Disappointed", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

The colors on the item were faded to where the print wasn\u2019t very visible. My husband (who doesn\u2019t usually comment on these things) said it looked faded. Despite this, the rest of the colors and lack of dark blue make this look childish and cheap in my space. The light blue and pink stand out the most. I almost didn\u2019t return it and almost decided to keep it and deal with it but for the price I paid for this (seems like way more than I should of) I decided to exchange it for a different rug completely.

The other two were much smaller. They seem to be adequate for what we use them for. One sections the paper has wrinkled and some of the hinges are loose but overall adequate. Now one problem we encountered with this item that we did not have with the other two is a strong smell of formaldehyde. That's what I said formaldehyde. The outside of the box even indicates that they used formaldehyde when making this and the other two room dividers. The odor on this one was so strong that we had to place it in our sunroom windows open to get rid of the odor. Factually, we had not even read the box the last two purchases because their just wasn't any odor, I still had the box from the last order and sure enough it too said formaldehyde, I think the seller should make us aware that they used formaldehyde, especially since since this is know to cause some medical problems. Had I know ahead of time I don't think I would have made these purchases. California requires a Prop 65 warning on the item which was on the box. I have COPD and this certainly can affect those without breathing problems, formaldehyde is also thought to cause cancer.

After testing them out on my hardwood floor, I was left with a couple of concerns. 1. The wheels will catch debris, and unless they are maintained consistently, will end up scratching the flood. 2. The wheels only have one point of contact with the floor, while traditional casters have two. While this decreases friction and helps them move easier, it could leave indentations in some flooring surfaces. 3. When moving while seated, the wheels can bind when changing directions, which was annoying. 4. This last issue seems a little silly, but these wheels move too well. I found myself gliding away from my desk unless I had my feet firmly planted on the floor. So, unless you are interested in some racing wheels for your office chair (which these would be fantastic for), I can't recommend them as a substitute for a good chair mat.", "review_title": "Will Still Damage Some Flooring", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

First, and most important, this pillow keeps your head flat with the rest of you. There is no propping up at any angle with this one. That said, I feel the position is natural and comfortable when on my back. My old pillows always left my head tilted up slightly when on my back so it took time to accept that this new position was good. Maybe it's more mental than physical? My other comment is that I sleep on my side a lot. The support under my neck doesn't feel like it is there. Maybe I should get the firmer pillow to see if that does better - could be my size. I also wonder if it's me and the introduction to a totally new type of pillow makes it seem like there's not enough support for side-sleeping. I can say the amount of neck pain in the past few mornings seemed to have diminished. Still some lingering, but no where near what I had before. Took a few mornings to get to this place and so far I'm pretty happy. Would I buy another pillow like this, yes. I actually will buy the firmer one at some point to see if my hunch is right.

But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all!

Some things were very obvious. Other things more confusing than you might imagine. I gave it 4 stars because it is beautiful, and it is exactly what I wanted. I'm hoping the problem with my unit was just a fluke, and that most units are perfect after assembly. But it took two people, over two hours, to put it together. On top of that, the roller tracks for the drawer, were not installed straight, and the screws (already installed prior to shipping) were half in, so the drawer wouldn't go into the track. We had to grind down the heads on the screws and straighten the side that was crooked, and the drawer still doesn't open easily. I can't just reach down and open the drawer to get a file. It takes both hands to get the drawer out. I'm honestly not sure I'll be able to use the drawer. At this price, I expected it to be perfect. I am honestly disappointed, because it is exactly what I wanted - if only it was functional. It fits both my printers, and it would eliminate the file cabinet I've been using, so you get so much function in a small space. I wish it worked like it was supposed to. I can't even think of returning it. Not going to take it apart to ship and return, after all this work. I think it's worth the chance - and hope you have better luck.

Having assembled it yesterday, key points: 1) It comes in a massive box, amazing it arrived so quickly with Prime 2) Assembling it with two people definitely recommended. Aligning some of the bolt holes required some maneuvering, but was not a big problem. 3) The cushions are all comfy! Definitely way comfier than the other mail-order couch I had previously and should settle a bit as we use it. 4) The seating is a bit shallow, but i expect the cushions to be worked in over time 5) Fabric is super soft 6) Could definitely fit 3 people, but the middle seat would just be more uncomfortable because it's between cushions All in all, I am pretty thrilled with a couch that arrived in 3 days!

Being the complete newbies in DIY flooring we are, there were very noticable seams in the floor where a new sheet began so I wanted a rug big enough to cover them up. I wanted a 4 ft x 5 ft rug because that's how big my space was, and this was one of the only ones I could find in the material/colors I wanted in that size. Our flooring is true white & gray hexagon sheet vinyl. I read reviews that said that the rug was definitely off-white instead of true white, but i loved the print, the size and the material seemed perfect for a kitchen. Since our flooring is so stark white,by comparison it makes the rug seem even more brown than white. But, we plan to paint our lower cabinets black and install butcher block wood countertops so I'm thinking the colors of the rug will match better (the off-white/brown colors in the rug will pop with the countertops). So, to summarize, PROS: -I LOVE the pattern of the rug -the material seems very easy to clean in a kitchen (or outdoors) -it is pretty soft (not plasticy or scratchy like some rugs) considering it can be used as an outdoor rug -the size fits perfect in my space -THE PRICE IS AMAZING. BEST VALUE! CONS: -if you're putting the rug against a stark white floor or furniture, the rug will appear to be BROWN rather than off-white", "review_title": "Rug is more BROWN (tan) than white if paired with true white floors/furniture", "language": "en", "product_category": "furniture"}

We decided to give this little cabinet a shot. ASSEMBLY: It took me about 4 1/2 hours to put this cabinet together. If you are unfamiliar with carpentry, you might want to consider hiring someone to do the assembly. Honestly, the instructions were trash. They were worse than useless. If I didn't have experience building furniture, I would have been totally lost with this thing. About half of the time was spent dry fitting parts to ensure I had the right holes lined up. However, once I had it together, it seemed quite sturdy. One hint I'll leave for everyone: gluing the joints and allowing to dry before putting anything in or on the cabinet is always recommended with assemble-yourself furniture. The lack of clear instructions is the reason I'm removing a couple of stars from my rating. APPEARANCE: The color is even and pretty close to what was shown on the product page, perhaps a half shade lighter. Once assembled, the doors and drawers open and close smoothly and hang straight and flush to the cabinet body. The lines are clean and the cabinet sits on a firm base without any wobble or tilt. As you can see, even the material is MDF, it matches well with our existing pine furniture. OVERALL: We have had this cabinet about 6 weeks now, and we're quite pleased with it. It's fulfilled its purpose. Not shown is the ample storage space behind the doors, where my wife has stashed a bunch of her small electrics. The two drawers are also larger than you might think.

Let's put things into perspective though, this is a $180 couch! I had three expectations when opening the box 1) be a couch 2) be easy to assemble 3) not be broken, that's it! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five, is because one of the legs was broken. However, it was fix-ably broken, just the small plastic end piece on one of the legs. I was able to call the superintendent he helped me superglue it back on and we were good to go. It was mildly inconvenient at worst, still as stated before I expected it to 'not be broken'. For those of you complaining about comfort, quality and/or style; what exactly where you expecting when you typed \"couch\" into the search bar, then selected \"price lowest to highest?\" I was expecting to spend at least $300. For $180 this is amazing! Also, the fact that it can hold up to 500lbs blows my mind, I wouldn't try that, but apparently a few people already have, and it didn't fall apart. In short, I absolutely recommend this couch to anyone who is A) single B) poor or C) both. I do not recommend this to anyone over 6 feet tall who is planing to sleep on it. It's only 66 inches long, since I'm only 69 inches long, I can sleep with my legs curled.

I am 5'3\" and my husband is 6', and neither of us are comfortable in these chairs. There is no neck support when the chairs are reclined and our feet dangle over the edge of the foot rest.

I decided to get a loft bed so I can place curtains on the bottom half for my desk area. Thankfully, this loft bed fits in my 8 foot tall ceiling and I could lay back on the wall to read. (I am 5\u20197 and 150 lbs.) however, I cant sit up straight or my head will hit the ceiling. My mattress is 10 inches thick and it fits fine on the frame but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for children. Space underneath fits a desk and bookshelf easily! The downside is the ladder is incredibly uncomfortable to climb up and the trip down is also an inconvenience (especially if you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.) If you have the money, get a loft bed with steps. Also, this bed seems to shake A LOT which makes me question how stable it really is. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t break on me because I have my computer setup right underneath. One last thing, BE CAREFUL WHEN ASSEMBLING! When I was on the step of putting the foot and head of the bed together, the middle long pole broke slightly due to its own weight when I picked up the frame. I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t be a problem because of the other support beams on the bed. I don\u2019t think this should last more than a year or two.

I would say this, the material for this chair is not that bad for its price. It's smaller than what I expected. I'm 5'5 and the head rest part is shorter than my head when I sit. I'm skinny and weigh 140 lbs and the chair has just enough space to fit me. The padding is not soft but im not expecting anything more considering its price. Im still using it tho for everyday gaming. Not like my back gonna break if i use this chair but If u want comfort then this is not the chair u want to buy. I mean if u want to buy this chair because ur on a budget like i was then its fine because its just a chair.

Also worth noting is that I got this desk almost exactly a year ago, and for $65, so do with that info what you will. Pros: Cheap, especially for what I paid, and lots of surface area. Cons: I knew this going in, but wow this is my first time owning a fully MDF product. I'm sure there's varying levels of quality in the stuff, but in this desk it's basically reinforced cardboard. I've already had an entire chunk of the desk break off (the wall piece on the back, behind the bigger portion of the L) Also, there's a major technical error: if you use the longer and deeper side of the desk (which I suspect most will), any chair with armrests that's wider than 23\" can not be under the desk due to the shelves, without bringing the left armrest under the smaller left side of the L completely.
