The style of roast is a little on the dark side, but not excessively so. It is very similar to the Spotlight brand I've been buying at Krogers.

This isn't super fancy, but it's straightforward coffee. The reason I ordered this was that I go through about a pound of coffee a week, and this will be a more convenient way to get it. What I don't know is how the beans will hold up sitting on the shelf for several weeks. The way I figure it, if the beans aren't as good in a few weeks, that's not the fault of the seller, so there's no reason not to give this a very good rating right now.

During the ride I had a total of 5 liters of water with endurance fuel, a PB&J sandwich, sports gummies and salt tablets.

I took the shot and within 30 seconds the feeling went away and I gained an extra boost to make it up the grade almost with ease. I was shocked and impressed. But after 20 minutes, while on my way back home and climbing one more smaller grade, both legs fully cramped up at the same time with crazy intensity!

I tried another one a few days later, thinking the first time must have been a fluke, but it happened again--only worse. Needless to say it was no fluke, and I won't touch them again.

After I ate three bags of these Swedish fish (over the course of a weekend), my stomach started hurting again and I became really bloated.

I\u2019m very upset that a company would lie about their ingredients. I saw several other reviews stating that their blood sugar spiked after eating these.

They used to use a white adjustable grinder top underneath the cap that worked amazingly. However they changed it to some cheaply incorporated top that is non adjustable.

The product inside is still amazing, maybe too much garlic now actually, but I love garlic so don't mind that. However there is no way to remove the top without breaking the container. So now I have to buy a spice grinder separate and carefully break this thing as to not fill it with plastic shards or lose half the bottle to transfer it to a new grinder. The only reason I will go through this hassle is the fact that no other spice company compares. I have looked far and wide for a garlic sea salt grinder to replace my empty one from olde Thompson.
