I assume it's piezoelectric, which means it translates the mechanical energy of pressing the doorbell button into enough electricity to send a signal to the receiver. No batteries to replace, and the button is rated at 200,000 presses before failure. Con: Whoever \"wrote\" the manual didn't speak English. They probably ran it through Google Translate and published that. It's not difficult for a tech to figure out, but if you aren't a tech, find a tech friend before you buy it.

We then programmed Alexa to start the coffee pot when you say the magic phrase (\u201cstart my day\u201d) and the coffee pot turns on. I can also do this from my phone in bed now. The light control is obvious. The heater is nice because we can turn it on when on the way home and it helps get the room warm faster. I happen to be a flight attendant and being able to turn it on from the airport is super handy. By the time I get home, the room is comfortable. Now if you don\u2019t have Alexa or the google mini, you can still use this. There\u2019s a free app called the geeni app that will turn your phone or tablet into the WiFi remote. I found out about the geeni app from a single plug I bought at Target, and I was relieved to see that Geeni is an app that works with Alexa. It also finds a ton of other smart controllable devices like my nest thermostat. Finally, in case you were wondering, the four usb plugs are all on one on-off switch.

If it's not in stock, it will take 4-6 weeks. But, of course, you can pay more for expedited shipping! Just my luck, my replacement is not in stock so I have to wait 4-6 weeks before I can properly lock my home again. Would not buy another and would not recommend.", "review_title": "Works Well if Not Defective (but apparently that's asking a lot) - Disappointing Warranty Program", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

You are better off buying lights without glue on the back and installing yourself. Flexible is also a misleading description for this item. I wrapped these lights behind my tv in straight lines with \"rounded corners\" so I didn't cut the strips. The moment you try to hang these lights any way besides straight (i.e. corners) you WILL HAVE TO USE SUPER GLUE. They do bend but if you aren't holding it in place then they go back to their natural state - straight. The remote control works well but the lights shows are not as customizable as the description made me believe. If you want to have the lights change color, it just cycles all the color values. You cannot have it just cycle between blue and white or something like that. I don't think these are actually capable of doing any colors besides those pre-installed on the remote.

Without being able to access the device's wifi gui via a url, it's difficult to troubleshoot beyond the app. I figured out a pattern during its reboot where I manually rebooted the device at a point where the blue light was solid. It became a trial and error. As part of troubleshooting, I also changed my wifi completely, creating new SSIDs of various encryption strength of different channels over the 2.4ghz range.

I had the plumbers install this in my new Jacuzzi bathtub. It looks great. However, I needed three fasteners to tighten the Faucet, shower head, and the handle, but only two were in the box. I contacted the company and Ian got back to me and sent the fastener by express mail. Then, the plumbers and General Contractor installed the tub, caulked and sealed. My wife noticed that there was a hairline leaking in the handle. Called the plumbers. They said, there is a plastic valve inside the handle, but it isn't standard, so they could not fix it and just put the valve back and asked me to have the company send me a replacement part. Contacted Ian at the company again and requested the valve. Ian sends me the valve hassle free. The part arrived by express mail again. This time, I personally shut the main water supply to the house and disassembled the handle and switched out the leaking valve...in the process, the handle is slightly misaligned, but it is actually economically better for usage. Turn the main water supply to the house, No leaking. Problem solved. Now, we have beautiful functional Jacuzzi bathtub with great aesthetically pleasing chrome faucet, shower head and ergonomically positioned handle. Great customer service from Ian. I would have given 5 stars, but I had to pay extra for the plumbers to problem solve the leaking valve in the handle, so have to be honest and take a star off. Otherwise, this is a great product, but the factory/manufacturers need better quality assurance program/process improvement in their inventory management.

To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3\" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say \"don't buy this\", but I would be forewarned.

I find the \"warm\" lighting offered with both types are still too cold for my taste. Some get it very close to warm/soft light, these are cold...nothing near warm...nothing beats the warm glow of incandescent lighting. Another thing I hate with led and florescent is the slight buzz or flicker my eye can detect. Did you know that led's can actually interfere with a garage door opener, reducing the range or the door not opening at all if the led light is close to the door opener antenna. Anyway, these are still a bit too cold and my eye can detect a slight buzz effect. They fit perfectly in my under counter puck light fixtures. The original xenon lights while casting a nice warm light got ridiculously hot! to the point I was afraid to leave them on too long! These led's are much better, very very well made...actually I'm very impressed with the quality. My set up isn't on a dimmer switch. After reading all the negative reviews about dimming issues. I will buy a led type dimmer switch and see how well they work. I have a feeling most negative reviews are due to incorrect dimmer switches and/or electrical disturbance from bad home wiring and poor grounding. led's are very sensitive to this. ***UPDATE*** I went out and bought a dimmer switch appropriate for Led lights and installed it. These work flawless, dimming all the way down without any flickering issues. I would think most people have the incorrect dimmer switch or poor electrical wiring not grounded correctly. even so, I may return these as they're a very cold, greenish white. Just not a pleasant tone even when turned down with the dimmer switch. Ultimately, these are not as described....says warm light....it's nothing near it. I have other fixtures with \"warm\" led lights and they are a lot closer to warm tones. If you don't mind a cold bright white with a slight greenish hue...these will work for you. Again, these are well made and work well with the appropriate dimmer.", "review_title": "I may return these as I feel the color is too harsh and cold toned...not warm as advertised", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

Does what it says it's supposed to do. I've managed to successfully set it up and connect/use it with Google Home app and control with my voice. Sometimes there's a bit of a delay when using Google to control it, but it's not terrible for my use-case. All features seem to work. It took me a little bit to set up because the instructions aren't very good. They call the app one thing in the instructions but the actual app is called something else. The QR code provided wouldn't work for me so I had to go digging around to figure out the correct thing to download. If you scroll through the Amazon item listing for it, it names the correct app to go find in the play store. The app itself works but isn't as user-friendly as it could be. The scheduling is in military time, I can't figure out how to delete schedules that are set up (can only edit or toggle on and off, but not delete), some more info on what each setting is for or how to use it could be useful, and updated/clearer instructions for setting up Google Home to use with it. Luckily I know how to add new devices in GH app, but for others this may be a larger issue. So as I said, decent for the price and does what it says. I think it could be a great little device if they improved the user-experience a bit more as far as instructions and app go so that things are consistent, clear, and using good English.

Took all of 2 minutes. That being said, I'd prefer if they sold it without supplying a duplicate sleeve since the existing one works fine, and cost could be reduced. Also since the LED produces a \"spot\" source of light, turning the head on my old Maglite does change the focus of the beam, but not in the same way as the original incandescent bulb.

A quick check with Nexx found that there were two iOS apps and the one I was instructed to use in the documentation that came with the Nexx was incorrect. After downloading the proper app things went pretty well. I really dislike the fact that a code must be used to open the door with the Echo. I dislike it so much I rarely use my voice to operate the door. I realize it is Amazon's fault because they require a code be used--it is not optional as it is in Google home--but I don't care. It should be up to me as to whether a code is required or not. It should not be mandated by Big Brother Amazon. For this reason I give the Nexx a 1 star for Alexa integration. === Aug 23, 2019 I've had the unit for a little over a month now and have been using it several times a day without a glitch--until today. It would not open the garage door. If I manually (with the wall switch) opened the door or used my car remote to open the door the action was logged in the app but pressing the open/close button in the app had no effect. I reset the Nexx by switching off power to the door opener, waiting 5 seconds, and restoring power. The Nexx operated normally again. Perhaps this 'glitch' is firmware involved. If so perhaps Nexx will eventually fix it. One other thing they could supply is a 'reset' button in the app. That might have solved my problem. I still recommend the unit. I can live with the glitch if it doesn't happen too often.", "review_title": "Sometimes need resetting.", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

They seem to be well built and don't leak after installation HOWEVER I did notice one immediate issue after they were installed. I observed a decline in my RO water flow rate when these valves were installed compared to some of the other name brands such as Sharkbite or John Guest. Being the inquisitive type, I starting looking into the reasons why because from the exterior they look nearly identical. However when you view the internal orifice of the valve, there's a white plastic cross member (see the photos for details) directly in the center of valve's flow path. Not sure the reason it's there but that would account, at least partially for the reduction of water flow from the RO system due to the obstruction by the cross member. Very disappointed because I was hoping for an affordable alternative to the very expensive name brand 1/4\" plastic valves. They may work for your application if your RO water pressure is adequate to compensate for the impedance from the cross member but it didn't pan out for me. Amazon's CS was great and I was allowed to return them for a refund within 30 days.

Let's get the positives out there first. The lights appear to be high quality and the color selections are virtually limitless. However, the brightness even at maximum is not overly bright, you would need at least 2 bulbs in the room for proper lightning. The drawback is that this bulb will only work if you have a wireless router running at 2.4 GHz. If you have an Xfinity router, they are dual band as 5GHz is the latest band for devices that use a lot of bandwidth. (2.4GHz means slower speed but further distance, 5GHz means higher speed at a shorter distance) The xfinity router will not recognize the bulb unless you change your network setting. You will need to open your network settings after you login to the site and choose to create 2 wifi channels with their own name and password.

I tried installing both \"bells\" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck.

Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how \"weatherproof\" it is.

The units generate enough heat to cause the thermostat to have false readings and the room temp fluctuates in a range of about 10 degrees over a 30 minute period. That's more than enough to go from feeling really cold to really hot. 1) The face plate generates heat, so the temperature is offset slightly. If this was the only problem you could just set the thermostat slightly higher to account for the change. 2) However, when the heaters turn on, the flow of electricity causes the unit to heat up unpredictably because of the variable flow.

They provide enough light for her to see the entire hallway, without being too bright or overwhelming. THe light doesn't reach too far into my bedroom, so my sleep isn't disturbed.

I would expect paying that much for a toilet seat, that it would last longer than this. For now, I have put super glue on it hoping that it will last for a bit longer.

The device was easy to set up as this is not the first camera similar to this that I have purchased and used. First my expectations were met with regard to the camera picture quality. Very good wide angle and picture quality is great in bright light. In the dark the IR LEDs provide plenty of light to make for a good picture quality. The problem is that the IR LEDs are VERY visible and they do NOT turn off. The app provides what seems to be a way to change the intensity of the IR LEDs from dark to bright, but this does nothing. Also, even when set to automatic in the app, the IR LEDs stay on. Even though the IR LEDs are set in the shape of the Bluetooth \"B\" logo any one who has any tech savvy about them will immediately notice the IR LEDs as just that, IR LEDs for a camera. So it is highly possible someone is going to know it is a hidden camera. If the IR LEDs could be turned off completely to use the camera in only a brightly lighted place, that would be great, but as I said these IR LEDs do NOT turn off at all unless you turn off the device. Also the setting in the app to only record when the motion alarm is triggered does not work. They are two seperate settings. In the app I set the motion detection alarm to alert me if motion and that part works. The recording options allow you to record ALL the time, Only during a scheduled time or only when motion is detected. The camera does NOT automatically start recording when motion is detected no matter how I configure the settings in the APP. So I am left to let it record all the time. All in all, I give it only 2 stars because of the IR LED and record on motion detection issue. I have another camera that works flawlessly exactly how I want it to, but they are no longer available, otherwise I would have just bought that same one. If they fix these issues, I have no doubt this unit would be 4 or 5 stars.", "review_title": "Not really \"Concealed\" Camera and does not record on motion detection", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

Study the instructions closely and review the pictures here on Amazon to ensure that you're placing the spikes in the correct order (short/long) to reach the desired outcome. The center ball has the holes drilled and threaded, as well as the spikes have their ends threaded. That's good. What's bad: the painting/powder coating fills in the threads. This makes the spikes not fit in 90% of the holes. A tap is provided, but that means tediously re-tapping the threads on all 120 holes for the spikes. Oh, and you can't tap the holes next to the lights, because you cannot rotate the tap with the lights in the way.

Generally speaking the material and the design are high in quality. The chrome finish is pretty, the stainless steel hose is long enough for all sort of use.

Also, the rechargeable battery cannot be removed and replaced. After about one year the current date and time is lost whenever power flickers for just a moment. Leviton seems to acknowledge the problem indirectly as their customer service has never argued when I request a warranty replacement. But, I am getting tired of the annual replacement schedule. I've also read a number of complaints about this issue on Leviton's knowledge base web page. So, it's not just me, and Leviton doesn't appear to be taking any corrective action.", "review_title": "Don't buy!!!! - Integrated backup battery fails", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

It was serviceable, but what a difference it was putting these in. The warm light reflects nicely off of my cabinets and my kitchen looks much less industrial and much more inviting. My only complaint, and it's a small one (no pun intended) is that these lights LOOK like they are replacements for your standard 3.5\" flood light, but they are much smaller, more like the diameter of a standard light bulb while having the shape of the flood you are replacing. It still works for my purposes. It's bright enough, and I like the warm color.

You won't be able to attach the strips on all 4 sides of something unless you bend it a bit; cutting it in 4 pieces will NOT work as only one side will work (the one that attaches to the USB wire).

After the last cleaning, the water temperature was initially very hot, then by the end of the shower had diminished to lukewarm. So, I bought this replacement. It does maintain a fairly constant temperature, buy the flow rate is somewhat lower than the original. The original used metal screens for the water to enter the cartridge through while this replacement uses what looks to be a composite material with holes in them. It looks like the screens were capable of passing more water through. They probably changed the design to counteract the mineral accumulation issue. The original was about 10 years old. I cleaned it by soaking in white vinegar for about a half hour. As a side comment, after initially installing the fixture we found the flow rate to be somewhat less than desired so removed the flow restriction washer.", "review_title": "Prior design was better", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

I don't see a way to contact the seller so I guess I'm stuck with a shitty adapter. UPDATE #2: I figured out how to contact the seller and explained the problem to them. The seller immediately sent out another whole light when in reality I had expected them to just send an adapter! It turned out to be a good thing because even with the new adapter I bought the thing was just dead as a doornail. I'm happy to report my new light arrived quickly and it works perfectly.

I estimate (by visual comparison) would be about 1,000+ lumens BUT since it has a very small lens area, it can NOT compare to a full sized flashlight light of similar lumens having lens areas 5 to 10 times greater.

There are parts in the kit that are not explained in the instructions, but are required for install, and the illustrations do not make it clear where to put the different spacers. Once installed, the wheel carrier impacted the bolt heads holding the 2nd rail brackets, and though the bracket holes are slotted, there are no instructions stating that you need to fully extend the brackets before tightening the bolts. There is no explanation about installing the door stops, so if you just install the stops at the end of the bar, both doors will slide the full extent of the bar, instead of perhaps stopping one door part way so that the 2nd door can bypass it and close the opening. Making an adjustment after the fact requires significant disassembly. Finally, the number of washers provided is insufficient to prevent the end of the bolt on the inboard most rail from extending through the bracket so far that it impacts the slider for the inboard door. This required adding washers and then finding a suitable paint to match them to the rest of the hardware.

It seemed to me that the issue was the rubber tip sliding on the painted door. VERY SIMPLE fix! I put a piece of clear shiny packing tape on the inside of the door where the dampener touches the door. This resolved the problem and has stopped the squeaking all over the home.

When I cleaned the gun I would run whatever solvent was recommended through the gun then take the nozzle pin and head apart and scrub those clean. Then wipe down the interior of the gun nozzle. The issue I had was the knob where you turn it from a line to a bead was getting paint backed up into that chamber. It got to the point where I was unable to turn it and it eventually snapped. I had to contact the company and get a replacement sent out and when I took it apart the interior was completely full of gunked up paint.

Next day went out and carefully looked at the connector clips. Noticed 2 tabs, that can open. Inside these tabs where 2 wires that come from the light and they can come out of connector clip. Glad I opened these, because the insulation on the wires was covering over the entire wire, not exposing any of the wires to make contact with the connector to the cable.

Now that the dog is a bit older and no longer in her 'damaging the house' phase, it was time to fill the holes made by her scratching. This Elmer's wood filler was the first product we tried and it turned out to be a fairly simple, effective and economical product to address the gouges. This filler application was easy; filling the voids with the spackle-like consistency of the filler which was squeezed directly from the tube. Getting it out is a bit difficult because of the filler's thickness, but overall that is a good thing because it does the filling job well. The color looks a bit lighter upon application but it dries darker and after a bit of fine grit sanding and some clear polyurethane as a topcoat, the floor looks almost back to normal. The filler takes about eight hours to dry and sets with a chalky consistency that sands off easily. If I were not aware of the scratches inflicted upon that area by our then new mongrel, I probably would not have noticed them and just thought it were the natural grain of the wood. I have attached BEFORE and AFTER pictures for reference. Overall, this a good product for a very reasonable price as long as the area you are filling is not too large.

Forgot that they are an old fashioned 'Thermostat' company. Maybe they should stick to their old, cheap thermostats, having them made, wherever they got them made, because, if it broke down, it would only cost me less than $20 to get a new one.

The camera connects to and Android app on your phone. You can use the app to control the camera pan, tilt, and take videos, pictures, and panorama views.

You can also set it to trigger on a baby crying but, not having a baby, I haven't tried it. I set it in my front window and it detected everyone that came to the door and every car that drove by. Also trees blowing in the wind when it's windy. You can set the motion sensitivity to high, medium, and low. When the camera memory is full it starts recording over the oldest clip in a loop. Which in my case is about 4 days worth. You can increase the memory by adding an SD card but the one I tried didn't work. Possibly because it wasn't fast enough since type 10 is required but I don't have another one to try yet. You can manually download the clips to the photo gallery on the phone. Unfortunately there is no PC app or any way to automatically download files to network storage, which I would have liked. The only way to automatically offload files from the camera memory is to subscribe to their cloud service. I also didn't find a way to control the length of clip that's recorded when it senses motion or how long to wait before re-arming the motion trigger.

I ordered another 2 the next day but this time one of them came a bit short of the quality I was expecting. I am aware no 2 lamps are alike and there will be irregularities in the form but this one had gray dark streaks that looked like mold around it and the light was concentrated only on the base of the lamp and the top third half just looked like a pink salt block, I am returning one of them. I guess 3 out of 4 is not bad, hence the 4 stars. Update: As soon as my review posted on Amazon Levoit contacted me directly, refunded my money and told me I didn\u2019t need to go through the hassle of sending the defective salt lamp, truly impressive customer service.

Finding screens in our part of the world is difficult, so we had a friend bring them in his luggage on a trip. Installation is pretty easy. Make sure to have the center of the top slightly higher than the corners, as some of the instructions describe. It makes a big difference on how easily it closes. Function is very nice. Walking through is easy and they usually fall right back into place. The dogs figured it out quickly and learned to use them without challenges. So we were very happy with these for almost six months. That's when the first seam started coming undone, the one along the top, allowing the screen to start drooping out. We patched it a bit, but within a few weeks it had reached a point where it had to be taken down so some more serious repairs could be made. A couple weeks later, another one started coming apart. This time it was along the opening, resulting in the screen separating from the hem and magnets falling out. So we've now had to take that one down too. So out of four doors, two of these started falling apart at about 6 months. These two were in doors that are used regularly, so they received more traffic. The other two seem to be holding up, but are rarely used. Basically we open the doors for ventilation, seldom passing through them. So perhaps those will last longer. The way they came apart, we can probably repair them. If not, then one needs to balance the idea of replacing them every six months with the value they provide. We're not sure what we'll be doing at this stage. It's too difficult to send them back overseas, so returning probably isn't worth it. At this price level, replacing them might be an option. I'd gladly pay more for something that would last years rather than months though.", "review_title": "Great idea with little durability", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}

I love that they come with drum shades and fit perfectly with modern and mid century modern decor. The shade screws on separately (not held on by the bulb itself) so there's absolutely no wobbling! These are surprisingly sturdy, even the pull cords are obviously made with quality care. I plan to buy more for my living room soon. They are true to the photo and a beautiful brushed nickel finish.

They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT \"self-leveling\" or \"easy to clean,\" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.", "review_title": "Good, and easy enough to use for the price!", "language": "en", "product_category": "home_improvement"}
