It should be renamed to \"Baby's First Cross\" or \"Children's Jewelry\". The cross itself is SUPER thin and the back is left hollow, not filled in, resulting in almost no weight. I was originally under the impression that the back would be filled in, especially with this much detail put into Jesus and floral designs. The bail used on the cross is more substantial than the rest of the cross in terms of thickness and weight. There's cardboard thicker than this cross. It appears that it will get bent easily. I worry that the bail will snap the pendant-loop because the loop is severely thin. Use caution on this fragile piece. AUTHENTICITY: No 10k gold stamp found. No certification cards included in the shipment. I will bring this piece to a jeweler to verify.... Otherwise, this cross only reminds me of costume jewelry. DELIVERY: Arrived fast! However, shipping label does say Claddagh Gold and there are instructions to leave it if no response, making it an easy target for someone to steal it!!!! Luckily, the carrier put it in the mailbox, but the label saying the shipper's name does not help. In past experience, things worth of value require signatures. PRICE: Not worth $50.

I still love the ring design and price point. However, as I noted in my original review, I have bad metal allergies. This is not pure stainless steel. I have other stainless steel jewelry that I can wear for days on end with no issues. I wore this ring several days in a row, removing it at night, and I began breaking out from where the metal was in contact with my finger. I'm not sure if it is the antiquing or if the steel is plated to make it a shinier silver. Whatever it is, it is definitely not pure stainless steel. Such a shame. At least I can wear this once in a while when I need a nicer looking ring. I have bad metal allergies and can only safely wear a few metals, making jewelry nearly impossible to find. Stainless steel is one of my few safe metals, so I have been searching for more right hand rings in steel. I decided to try this ring as I love roses and this fit my simplistic style well. I just got it tonight and love it. I ordered a 7, and it is a perfect fit. It has a low profile to my finger. I wear it with the vine to the top of my hand, and even still it goes almost from my middle joint to my top knuckle. It stays put well and doesn't slide around. And it has a very solid feel to it. It does not look like a $10 ring at all, but it was worth the price.", "review_title": "Cheap but great quality", "language": "en", "product_category": "jewelry"}

There was nothing holding the individual pieces in place, but at least the balls were all screwed on. Luckily, there was no scratches on the material. Putting them in: difficult. One of the balls was stuck on and I couldn\u2019t get it to budge at first. I almost considered returning one set but I was able to get t off after about 10 minutes of trying. Putting them in was challenging because I can\u2019t see behind my ear of course. I\u2019ve been wearing them for a couple weeks now, and I am still pleased. I have very sensitive skin, and I\u2019ve experienced no irritation. The balls have not loosened, and the jewels still fit securely in their settings.
