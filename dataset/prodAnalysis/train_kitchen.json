I bought this mixer thinking that if my stand mixer is so well made and has a lot of power then this hand mixer has to be the best-NOT!!!!!!!!! I am totally disgusted with this piece of junk!!!! It is all plastic and the little bit of power is lame!! My old mixer had a power boost-this one does not but it seriously needs one!! The controller on top is a pain- you turn on the mixer and then you have to hit a rubber button over and over until you get your speed. If you have to turn it off to add ingredients,scrape the bowl etc. you turn it on again it starts on low again so you have to use this button and bump up the speed- the rubber button will wear out before the mixer (maybe).

I purchased it for a Polar Cube icing machine to ice my back after surgery. (My prior back surgery, we had to keep running to the store every 2 days to buy ice). It is SO easy to use!! Just pour in the water into the main area, and the machine does the rest. With the push of a button, you can change the \"size\" of the ice cubes which is actually their thickness. It makes 9 cubes at a time, I wish it was more, but it still fills up the ice holder. To keep it going, I just empty the ice into gallon sized zip lock bags. It sits near the fridge, it doesn't need a drain and it looks attractive. The biggest problem with refrigerator ice makers, is that they can cause undetected leaks, that can cause terrible damage to a house. It did it to my fathers kitchen floor and ruined a structural beam that ran through the kitchen and laundry room. Thousands of dollars of damage to hos house!! When this icemaker fills to capacity it will shut off an a red light will come on, and it will wait until you empty it enough to get below the full mark. I accidentally left it overnight, and the icecubes were in fine shape, only a couple had partially melted (the water returns into the system to make more ice). So even though it is not meant to have the ice just sitting in it \"like a freezer\", I was impressed that they kept in as good of shape as they had! Love my icemaker and highly reccomend it!!

If it didn't have the flaw it would be a 4 or 5 star product, it only gets 2 stars because it can be fixed. I had my first grinder replaced for free and without question. However the replacement grinder did not last long. This is because the charging port breaks. The charging port is more deeply recessed then it should be so you can't use most other micro USB cables, only the one they include (which is very short). But more over the charging port has two metal tabs on the side of it that are deeply recessed. After time the tabs either get bent inwards and/or the port shifts its angle slightly and when you insert it the charger will bend the tabs. Once this happens you can no longer charge the grinder making it useless. This is poor design on an otherwise fine grinder. This problem can be fixed by using something very thin and stiff, I used a very small hex wrench. Using it I could unbend the tabs and force the charging port back into alignment. I don't know how many times this can be done, but you are probably risking breaking the charging port. If they would simply move the charging port to the standard depth and put some reenforcement around it to keep it from rotating they could probably fix this issue. If it needs to be recessed that deeply for some reason then they should simply use a more robust custom charging port since you can't use a standard micro USB charger for it anyway.", "review_title": "A good grinder with a very significant flaw", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I ordered a new one but the power cord is too short and does not wrap around the base long enough for the cord to be properly stored (see photos). It is about 1\" too short. This makes all the difference when you want to keep it handy on your counter top. I still consider it a good deal because of the low price. It is convenient, compact, easy to clean, and very handy.", "review_title": "Overall good, but defective power cord on some units, blad dulls quickly", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I felt it was unsafe to consume the dispensed water. Detailed: I've ordered several DA29-00020B filters on Amazon prior to this recent order and never had an issue. This two pack of filters were a few dollars less than my original orders so I thought I'd gamble on saving a few dollars and hope to receive an adequate product. I gambled and lost. I installed the new filter cartridge in the same manner of my previous filters and read the instructions that came with the filter to flush it correctly. Per the instructions you are advised to run water through the dispenser for 6 minutes (3 gallons) to purge the system. I aired on the side of caution and dispensed 4 gallons of water in several batches into a measuring cup. I grabbed a clean drinking glass and filled it up and began to lift the glass to drink. That's when I noticed floating debris in the water. The best description I can give would be small pieces of transparent material... like plastic were swirling around in my glass. I fished a couple pieces out with my finger to feel the texture, but it didn't feel like anything... but I could clearly see the debris in my hand as I moved it around. As for the size of the debris... it varied, but the larger pieces I'd estimate as half the size of the letter \"O\" on a standard keyboard... I don't know what else I could compare the size to that would be comparable for other customers. I decided to flush more water through the dispenser with a new glass. I told myself, maybe the glass I used had something in it... Well, that wasn't the case, after flushing an additional 5 gallons of water through the dispenser, I still had floating debris in my water. Now, each time I dispensed water, I checked it, and the debris did seem to be reducing...but it was still a lot. At this point I've dispensed nearly 10 gallons of water, which I saved for alternative use, like my humidifiers and to water plants... but I felt I would never be able to flush all the debris out of the system with out eventually wasting water. I don't want to spend half the life the cartridge on flushing the debris out of it... I requested a refund and received it immediately. I never tried the second filter that came in the order, I didn't want to take the chance of wasting water, nor my time. I'll be ordering the same model filter again, but from a different manufacturer.", "review_title": "Debris in dispensed water - wasted water and time", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

This tamper will take that variable out of your equation, allowing you to focus solely on either dose or grind until you get things perfect.

One HUGE gripe i had with it though is with the included anchor screws for mounting in drywall: they suck... like, a lot, for my walls at least. They're very large in diameter and it did not go into my wall smoothly. Instead it kind of ripped up/shredded my wall which caused parts of the wall to stick up and the anchor screw could not sit flush. Since this anchor screw is huge, it stuck out a lot. So we took it out and used our own, smaller anchor screw. Fits the same screw the kit comes with but the anchor screw part is just smaller diameter and the threads aren't sticking out as much. Now the knife block still sticks out a tad because we didn't try to remove the wall parts that stuck out but it's not really noticeable since we tightened the mounting screws enough to squish it down a lot and our anchor screw was small enough to not cause a problem either. The other side of the knife block is screwed into a stud so we didn't need an anchor.", "review_title": "great except included anchor screw super sucks", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

The first replacement filter lasted 9 days, and clogged on the 7th day. Same for the second. The third filter has been in used for 23 hours and the meter already indicates 1. This is after only one fill up of the 30 cup container. Zero water support did not want me talking to their quality control or development sections. They also said when the filter clogs you remove it beat rapidly on it, then reinstall at which point you will see bubbles from the trapped air being released. Again this was not so. I never saw any bubbles and the filters failed within 24 hours of preforming this procedure. They also said no difference between filter provided with the product and replacements, yet the results demonstrate there is a big difference in quality. When you call customer service the canned announcement states if you do not want to wait press #1 leave your name, contact information and a Customer Rep will call you back. I used this option twice and I never did receive a callback. The majority of customer reps I spoke with, including their supervisor who was exceptionally rude and condescending. Added info: The fourth filter clogged almost immediately. Only one 10 glass of water ran through and it clogged.

About a week after I received them and had four of the six holding a notice on my refrigerator door - I brushed my shoulder against one and it fell to the floor from a height of almost 6 feet. The result was a tail and leg completely broken off, and I now have five cat butt magnets. So I'm giving them 4 stars because they should have made them out of a stronger resin, or possibly a material that's more pliable and less prone to break on impact. Lesson learned - I now only use them on the side of my refrigerator where there is less chance of another one getting knocked to the floor and broken. I usually lose my refrigerator magnets because the magnet part detaches from the body of the magnet.

If this were specifically made for a sous vide attachment a flat tab on one side would be very helpful. The second complaint, and it is with the rolled plastic lip, is trying to use clips for attaching bags to the side. Because of the width of the lip it is difficult to get clips on there.

Had I not been home there is zero doubt it would have continued until it exploded and what, catch fire? I just contacted Amazon customer service and was put through some ridiculous \"reset\" which would have accomplished nothing to fix the problem then was informed I would need to contact the manufacturer as the return window has closed. REALLY? Amazon refuses to, on their own, take care of this very evident fire and safety issue where they certainly would have born some responsibility had my house burned down and is forcing me to \"fix\" the problem on my own. Had I purchased this from target or another store I simply would have returned it for a new one, which is exactly what Amazon should be doing right now. The agent clearly did NOT understand what the real issue is and has caused me to rethink every purchase I make through them. I strongly suggest any reader seeing this to do the same. They could care less when they clearly are selling defective merchandise, they take zero responsibility and the consumer is on their own. Buyer beware, your house could easily burn down and they don't care! **UPDATE** I just posted this the day before yesterday and got no help from Amazon at all, and now the kettle won't shut off at all. You have to unplug it to get it to immediately start boiling water, it WILL NOT stop boiling until you unplug this extreme fire hazard. I'm handicapped and had this put on my bedside table as I do nothing except drink tea all day, so I have watched this piece of garbage go from working well to a complete disaster in less than six weeks.

So did, the nut on the pour spout. I assumed those parts were aluminum. I continued to wash it and they stayed the same and nothing was chipping off, so after I rinsed it, I made just a ten cup pot of coffee to test it. It started brewing almost immediately, and you could hear a bubbly noise. Then, after a minute it started brewing and you could see in the clear lid handle that it was. After 10 minutes, the red finish brew light came on and it was done. No grounds were in the coffee and it had good smell, color, and tasted good. I recommend, a few extra tablespoons of coffee grounds, for a more richer flavor. This will be used for many events, so I\u2019m curious how it holds up. It is very lightweight, so transporting it should be easy with the nice cool touch grabber handles. I tried one more cup about 30 minutes later, and it seemed still very hot.

It looks sleek and nice. It fits under cabinet fine. But when lifting the head, it hits the wall, so it has to be pulled out some, wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but the awesome thing that keeps it from bouncing around(suction cups on the bottom), makes it a bit of an ordeal. But easily ignored. The one thing I am very disappointed about, everytime I use it, is how far the mixing tools(paddle and whisk) are from the actual bowl. Easily 1/4 of an inch away.

Each compartment holds a decent amount of food. They hold up well in the freezer and in the microwave. I was even able to microwave with the lid on and it did not warp. My only problem with these containers is that they are not made out of a flexible enough material and the lids and plates are prone to crack or break if you are not extremely careful. One of my plates did arrive with a chip on the corner of the lid. These seem to be leak proof so far, but in order to acheive this you must make sure that the lid is on tight. Each side must be slowly pressed so that you here a click from each of the tiny clips that line the lid. Press up and down the sides of the lid until you don't hear anything snap and your tray should be sealed. Opening the lid is very difficult because if you are not careful the lids or the tray will crack or chip. I have 3 trays to chip or crack since I purchased these containers. I like the concept of meal prep and these containers work for what I need for now. I do wish they were made out of a stonger material.", "review_title": "They work, but needs stronger material.", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

When you press the cheese, you have to be careful to make sure that the disk continues to push down flat on the cheese and does not go lop-sided at a diagonal and go out of place, but you can easily see through the holes and loosen the press and re-press if you see this happening. You will need a cheese cloth to go with the press, which is not sold with the press. You can remove a lot of moisture from the cheese with this press. I used this for pressing soft cheese made from 2 gallons of regular temperature pasteurized whole milk curdled with lemon juice. In order to press this much cheese, I filled it up completely once, but it wouldn't hold all the curds in the first press, then pressed out the liquid, then unscrewed the press, and put in the rest of the cheese. In this way, it could press the amount of curds that comes from two gallons. The total volume inside the container is about 7 cups, bur remember you have to press the cheese down so your total at the end will be less than 7 cups.

No more wrapping bulk meat purchases in saran wrap and then a freezer bag...just seal my purchases using my handy vacuum sealer bags and machine, pop them in the freezer, and feel confident that they will last much longer!!!", "review_title": "Great Product", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I purchased my first one in December. I instantly LOVED it for making Bullet Proof Coffee. Loved it so much that I ordered a second. My original mug (black) keeps on stirring like a champ. I took it to work and use it every morning. I clean by putting boiling hot water & a drop of soap and letting it stir the soap around. The I wipe down the inside & rim with a paper towel, rinse, and dry. It gets a 5 star review. My second mug (blue) I ordered in January. It is at home so only used on the weekends. It has been less than a champ and ended up being tossed in the garbage. Despite cleaning them the same (and my black one being cleaned way more frequently than the blue one) the blue one would always leave wet rings even after being hand dried. As I investigated the rubber bottom was not water tight and the chrome ring around the bottom was not attached. This means that when I dumped the contents of the cup, the liquid would run down the side, under the chrome, and into the battery/ motor compartment. I dried the compartment out, put new batteries in and it worked for about 1 day and then died. New batteries. Still dead. Flustered I tossed it. I think these are hit & miss. I will go back to using my frother at home on the weekends.", "review_title": "Hit & Miss", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

The instructions for cleaning that come with this are more geared towards caring for a skillet - for example, it says the key to a good seasoning layer is buffing, which makes sense for a cast iron skillet, but not for a grill. Getting in between each grill grate with a thin layer of oil and \"buffing\" it in is a lot more difficult than oiling a skillet. That said, it's worth the labor to get to the end result of perfect grill marks and flavor. It's also worth noting that this griddle is too wide to be used on a long 5th burner. It's more for use across two adjacent burners. If you use this on a 5th burner in the middle of your stove, there's not much room for anything else on the stove top.

Second, the whole outer unit is no better than those ultra-cheap ones which show up at discount stores around Christmas for 8 bucks--definitely not of a quality matching the fairly-high by comparison asking price.

In the lower position the rack comes very close to the door when sliding it out. This item seemed like a good solution. I was disappointed to find that the hooks are too closely spaced to fit over the outside edge of the Samsung's grate. The item is not worth returning but if you're willing and able to clamp it up in a vise and start bending the jaws and file rough edges you can make it work for this purpose. The metal jaws are quite heavy gauge but with effort it can be de-burred with a file and the middle jaws bent inward to accommodate the thicker leading edge of the Samsung grate.", "review_title": "Heavy duty but needs work.", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

Cons: No place to store the juice Spout is too low, you need to use short glasses to catch the juice While my last juicer wasn't quite as powerful, I liked it much better and it was much cheaper. It stored the juice and doubled as a pitcher when done. This one just spills it out a spout and you need a short glass to catch it. You'd have to then transfer it to a pitcher cup by cup. Also the spout is low. None of my glasses were short enough to fit! I had to position it over the counter edge and use one hand to hold the glass.

I started out looking at the decorated teapots, but when reading the reviews was so disappointed...it's the one- and two-star reviews that I pay attention to. My eyes kept looking at this one as I would skim past, so I decided to take a look at the reviews and liked what I read. It's plain, but when I opened the box (in which it is protectively packaged), I was so very pleased! I looks so elegant! And it is the perfect size for a young lady to allow her to do the pouring, yet holds enough for three our four to have a nice spot of tea! I used to work in a tea house, so I know of which I speak. That's why I gave five stars already for cleaning, use and, of course, value...I've washed enough tea pots to know! The lid lip is the only part I would make an adjustment on...it's purpose it to keep the lid from coming off during pouring. It doesn't extend out far enough to really catch. So, I will just teach my granddaughter to keep a finger or two on the lid as she pours...no biggie. I believe she will love this elegant, light and smaller size teapot! I will write again after the tea party should I need to adjust or add any further comment.

It fits tightly and doesn't leak but feels chincy and the spout is Definitely too small. It isnt made from drinking directly from but also isn't big enough to pour smoothly into a cup or water Thermos.

I burned through a couple before I figured out exactly what the problem was. Since this is a relatively new company, it will be interesting to see if they can learn from these early mistakes and improve on the design. If they can't do it soon though, I'm betting a competitor with a better design and superior materials will bury them.

Had I seen their price and read the reviews for myself, I would have immediately canceled the order and questioned her sanity. We had to send one back within 30 days because, just like so many other reviewers here, we saw vertical cracks appearing in the corners. This is apparently a structural issue with these boxes, because one of the two remaining units now has a crack in it as well (see photo). Secondly, the rubber seal in the lid pops out all too easily. That wouldn't be such a big deal in and of itself, but without the seal the lid won't mount properly to the box. I could live with these defects if the boxes were handy in use, but they're in fact so small that there's hardly any space in each compartment. Want to pack the kids a tasty hard-boiled egg? You're out of luck: It's too large and will crack just as rapidly as those corners of your Bento box. And the small metal container THAT COMES WITH THE BOX is high enough that you won't actually be able to close the latter unless the former is placed perfectly in the middle. I don't dole out one-star reviews that often, because I have enough business experience myself to be aware that there are actual people on the receiving end of my criticism, not robots. But $40 is an outrageous price of this flawed product. You'd be better off with a simple one-piece box with a lid and some small containers to keep your salad from spilling over onto your sandwich.

In order to be a mold , in this case to allegedly make round and square ice cubes, the two parts need to join together in order to impart a shape to the material. For this product, they don't, the top of the round mold is so thin and light weight that it simply floats off, there is no mechanism to join the two they simply sit one on top of the other. For a mold this is an exceptionally poor design. The square mold suffers the same issue, its so thin walled and flimsy that it cannot hold its own shape even when full of water. If you are extremely careful and have a flat perfectly level spot to place the square mold full of water with extreme care and you don't move too fast from the sink to the freezer you may be able to act with enough gentleness to not disturb it and possibly get an ice cube. For me this would be far more trouble than its worth.", "review_title": "DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

You are required to remove thick plastic that is wrapped around each piece of acrylic in order to see each clear acrylic piece.

Putting the four pieces together is pretty obvious, but you can tell right away that this isn\u2019t a very sturdy stand. If someone removes a push pop from the middle, the stand becomes pretty unstable. We used this at a kids birthday party, so we had to make sure that the push pops were evenly distributed after a kid took a push pop. Even with all of that, the stand looks okay. If you\u2019re handy, it might be a good idea to super glue the stand together to make it stable. Of course, doing so makes the stand more cumbersome to store for future use.

Worked great for a while. Loved being able to cook small amounts of rice just form my husband and I. Was perfect for cooking for two. However, after using it for maybe six or seven times in the 6 or so months that I have had it, it quit working. So I went back to look at the reviews on this product. I know that there a lot of reviews that are four and five stars. But in reading more of the two star reviews found that I have the same problem that most of these reviews mentioned, in that the cooker quit working after about two months or five or six times of using the product. the design may have some to do with why the cooker quits working. With mine the cooker seal did not keep the water from boiling over in to the chamber the rice pot sets in and therefore water gets into the heating element and more than likely shorts out this element.

Second, if we fill the grounds container more than about 2/3 full we will end up with grounds in the coffee and all over the plastic basket.

So the roller is wonderful. Part of me is wishing I just bought the roller by itself. Upon opening the box, the two other pasta cutters had metal rods and plastic combs rolling around in the box with them. It says nothing about these items in the manual. I was assuming they were part of the packaging, but they are likely necessary to the function of the cutters to release the dough maybe? I'll have to wait to find out if that will make it functional, however, because while trying to feed dough into the cutter, it made a loud clunk, that I later discovered was the snapping of the hex bolt that turns the blades inside the cutter. I thought about returning this item, but being that it took me and hour to scrape out all of the pasta dough from the crevasses of this thing, I don't want to deal with shipping it back and hoping they refund my money for a dirty machine. I found a replacement bolt and will fix the roller and see if using the combs will fix the problem. Really wishing kitchenaid had better instructions in the manual for this product.

I've been waiting for 6 days for them to respond since I replied with my request for a new squeezer but still no answer.

Also, needed to buy little baggies to put them in, that way if they do break during the baby shower, it\u2019s within each baggy.

The blender is super powerful and works great. The reason why I didn't enjoy this blender is because its not user friendly whatsoever. In the description it mentions having 6 timing settings so I was thinking that I could set those myself and just push the button and it would store my time. Basically those 6 preset timers are just the time thats set on each function. For me the blender was really annoying because I was looking for something that I could pretty much just turn on and keep running for however long I wanted and increase the speed when I wanted. On this blender, each function ( juice, ice cream etc) has its own preset time and once the time is up it stops, each preset is like 2 minutes. Once it stops you have to start the whole process again. Most of the time I would use the pulse function and then I'd have to set my own time so I'd have the press the time button over and over again until I reached the time I wanted which was really annoying. This blender is also really loud and heavy. Another reason I didn't like the blender was because I always had to use the tamper, if I was making a smoothie my fruits would get stuck under the blade and I'd have to tamper around with them. I expect for the kind of money I spent on this blender to be able to put the fruits and juice in and it does everything by itself. The last reason I dislike this blender is because of the pour spot. It was so messy and never poured properly into my cup if I made a smoothie. If these things don't really bother you then this blender is perfect for you. It was super powerful and once tampered with enough, everything was blended up really well and it made great a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls and smoothies, I just felt like it took too much work and time to play around with such a pricy blender.", "review_title": "Very powerful but not user friendly", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

Poured his second cup, and was let down. The tea did not stay hot, as advertised, and consequently, he needed to warm it in the microwave (the cup of tea, not the entire pot).

So I had to blow each letter up again and then tape the bottoms to keep them from deflating. Would have been nice to get some instructions so I could have avoided all these extra steps. 2. It came with an extra C instead of a G. Thankfully it was still funny without the G but I would have been screwed if it were any other letter.

Originally I had to return the first product since they shipped it to me with both parts (body and cover) taped. The kettle was of course cleaned before use and no tape was visible. However over time after a few uses we noticed the markings of the tape and it started having a burnt smell. Amazon of course replaced the product. I've been using this for quite sometime now and found it to be decent. If you tilt it too much during pouring the water does burst out. However, unless you buy something with rubber in it to regulate the flow it probably will never be perfect.

I can't even crush them rather I was getting chunks as such and I'm sure if the meat is very soft, probably it just presses it a little to make some little cutlets. The quality is not that great, I understand that's what I get for what I pay, but I feel they could have done it a little better. Yes, as the description says, it can grind pepper, but definitely not good for smooth finish of the vegetables. The image description says it can grind peanuts, please! It definitely doesn't have that much capacity. So basically this is a plastic one with a metal strip inside, if you give much pressure, I'm sure one or the other plastic parts is going to break.

And this is my first non-electric grinder so my perceptions are colored by those things. The grinder seems well-made. All the parts fit well together and the design appears to have been well thought out. The ceramic conical grinder is sharp and grinds very efficiently. It does take longer to grind enough coffee beans for my morning coffee than I thought it would. I'm usually making 1/2 liter of coffee and it's taking me 4-5 minutes of grinding to produce enough ground coffee. In order to save time in the morning when I have to be out the door and on my way to work early I grind the beans the night before rather than just before i brew the coffee, which was my pattern with my old electric grinder. Grinding enough beans for several people to have coffee would be a chore. When i first got the grinder I followed the directions to take everything apart so I'd know how it was put together. It's a bit of a process to get it all apart and you lose your grind setting when you do take it apart. One minor frustration is that there's no indicator to show how fine the grind is set for. Even if it's arbitrary, if I know I want it set for, say, a \"5\" then after I take it apart to clean everything I could reset it for a \"5\". As it is, the closest I can come to that is to tighten the screw down as much as possible for the finest grind possible then count clicks back to the spot I want. That isn't as convenient as having a number to which I can refer. It would also be nice to have it be easier to access the burr to clean it. Having to disassemble the entire unit means I don't bother taking it all apart and keeping everything as clean as I'd like. I'm used to quick and easy accessibility with my electric grinder for cleaning. It's a good, well-made grinder that does the job. There are things I'd like to see that would make it easier to live with but, overall, I'm happy with it.", "review_title": "Lots to Like", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

This can be remedied by tossing them into a bowl, stirring, then placing them back into the basket for even browning. However, I give this product a Poor Rating, because with one of the Air Fryers, the Basket would come unfastened in the middle of cooking, and the base would drop to the floor. At one time, I came very close to being injured. It was due to a small crack just above the handle (see photos). I reached out to the company, hoping they'd send me another basket, but they said they don't sell nor ship out parts. In addition, I was told that I was no longer under my 90 Day warranty. Despite explaining that I had merely gotten two months of use sporadic use from this item, they didn't care. I made the mistake of assuming I had a 1 Year warranty, as I do with most of my purchases.

Today began a new issue. The coffee pot begins to brew a pot, gets 1/3 of the water out of the reservoir, then beeps as if it is done. I'm having to repeatedly turn the unit back on 3 and 4 times (on my second pot today) to get a full pot to brew. I bought Cuisinart based on the fact that it used to be a trusted name. I had a model like this several years ago and it lasted me for over 5 years. However it seems that Cuisinart, like other manufacturers are content with cranking out cheap products for full retail price in the hope that when it breaks in a year, we'll come back and buy another one.

The product isn\u2019t good, it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s a waste of money, period. I bought this to make grinding weed faster...or so I thought. This device is probably best used for herbs and spices but not weed. This device doesn't allow for a good amount of weed to be put into it and you basically have to grind it down yourself to fit it in-between the teeth in order for the top piece to fit back on. So it holds very little herb. It gets stuck all the time and I constantly have to use the cleaning tool to get the weed out. I compared it to my handheld grinder and I got a lot more weed out of my handheld with a lot less hassle. It's a good concept but it just doesn't work well for weed. I also think it would be better if you could feed the weed through the cone-shaped top and then have it grind down instead. Because the reason I think this doesn't work is that in order for the top to go back on and work, you can only put in a minimal amount of weed and you must break it down into very small pieces which negates the entire reason I bought this. I am looking for a faster and easier way to grind a larger amount of weed at once. I would not recommend this for anyone looking to use it for weed. I can't say how it would be with other herbs and spices but since I have this, I may one day try it out for other use. Though I still think it will be more work since the area where you put the herb in is very tight and only allows a small amount inside in order to put the top piece back on.", "review_title": "Not Worth It...for Cannabis Use", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I guess they saw how much I liked it and decided it was easier to steal than buy one themselves. So here I am back to buy another one. Going to use the same O-ring fix I described before on this one to keep the silicone piece in place. Seriously, try it if you are having that problem. It works good. Original Review/fix So when I bought this thermos, I read a lot of reviews that people were having problems with the lid. Where the silicone piece would get loose and the lid would fail to open when you push the button. I read that a lot of people were buying new lids from the manufacturer because the silicone piece was not able to be purchased by itself. Well I'm not sure if the silicone piece just ended up getting loose over time, but the problem with mine was shortly after I bought it, that silicone piece started slipping off the lip that is on the cap. So I was trying to figure a way to keep that from happening, and this is what I came up with. Go to Lowe's and buy the delta o-ring set for repairing a faucet. I included a picture with the model number. It has four o rings, they are the same diameter but 2 are thicker. Well I took off the white silicone piece that seals the lid, and I put the two thicker O-rings over the circular area and pushed them down so that the silicone piece that opens the lid cannot slip over the lip. Then I put one of the smaller O-rings at the top of the other two to keep them from moving up. Pictures are included to kind of show you what I did. I've been using it about a week and so far so good. Now if that silicone piece that opens the lid gets too loose then I imagine it will eventually stop opening the lid but my solution fixes it from slipping over the lip. Hope this helps somebody else out there.", "review_title": "Silicone piece slipping off the lip? Try this", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

Great grinder to pull out and turn some heads. Not too light and too heavy with a smooth textured feel to it. The item comes with 3 compartments: milling (top), herb catcher(middle), and pollen catcher (bottom). Pretty much what one would expect from the grinder. Now there are major drawbacks to this item. The milling action on top is mediocre at best and this is due to two factors: 1) the diamond shape teeth do not provide a fine grind 2) When twisting to grind the herb you will find there quite a bit of friction between the connecting ends of the top and middle piece of the grinder, so where one would expect a \"fast\" and \"smooth\" grind as advertised instead you will find yourself applying quite a bit of pressure as you hear metal on metal grind. Now the biggest drawback to the grinder is not the milling action, but the pollen catcher (on bottom). Unfortunately, the pores to the pollen catcher are too large and more than pollen gets through the pores. In other words expect to get grinded herb with pollen in the pollen catcher.", "review_title": "An eye-catcher and looks great.

This did not fix the pressure problem, just the cleanliness problem. However, I started using a thumbtack to clean the drip point in the metal cup that holds the coffee. This aha moment did not come from customer care but has taken care of the problem. Originally I had this at 5 stars for making great cappuccinos. Went down to 1 star when it stopped working more than 50% of the time. Bringing it up to 3 stars as the machine seems good, but the experience with Customer Care and having to figure out how to get it working right was not awesome. Original review: Good: When it works it makes great espresso and cappuccinos. It is easy to clean, although the sealed metal filters that came with the machine would retain water. Bad: After a 9 months the pressure was insufficient to get the double shot to go thru. No change in coffee brand. Ugly: Spoke with their customer care several times, and it seemed more like they wanted to get me not to submit a claim against the warranty than to help. Just because it made 1 cup 1 time, does not mean it wasn't failing 95% of the times. I still don't know what's wrong with the machine, if it is fixable or not, but now its outside of warranty.

After chopping up cabbage, I realized a piece of the knife was chipped off and lost somewhere in my cabbage slaw! The reason why Im giving this product a 3 star is because since I chipped my first set, my brother in law sent me the same link he used (which was this product link). I bought a set, but to my disappointment, this new set was not as sharp as my previous set. The color was also different (pink). The one I had was much darker pink and now its very light colored. The fruit peeler didn't even peel the fruit skin. Instead, it was so dull that it took chunks off of the fruit. So I ordered ANOTHER set (set number 3) hoping it was just a manufactures defect.

For our infrequent waffle making (I've only used it 3 or 4 times in the last 2 months) it is a decent fit for our needs, especially the size. Small and light. However, when making Liege waffles with Pearl sugar, it doesn't seem to have enough power (even on \"Max\" setting) to quickly cook the outside to a crispy consistency and caramelize the sugar while not drying out the center of the waffle. You can of course simply leave it on longer to get the outside crispy and caramelized but then it runs the risk of drying out the inside. Best I can do it let it pre-heat on 'Max' temp and get nice and hot and also make sure the Liege dough is fully at room temp (and not any colder). It mostly works but does seem underpowered a bit to me. Maybe a compromise for having the compact form factor. Works better for regular (American style) batter-based waffles than dough-based ones in my experience. Another thing I don't like about it is that the two halves cannot lock together. So you close the two halves tightly initially, but then as the waffle rises, it will separate the two halves. I'd like a \"snap\" to at least have the option to keep it closed. But, alas, if you want to keep it closed, you will have to either hold it shut for several minutes or come up with your own clamp or apparatus to keep it closed. On the flip side, it does clean up extremely easily with a wipe of a damp paper towel as the non stick surface is very smooth. A few months in, no issues with flaking of the ceramic coating. But time will tell how well it holds up. I'm moderately happy with it but I've definitely used much better and more versatile waffle makers.

I had seen Rachael Ray use a similar tool to slice garlic and thought it would be a time and cleanup saver. The first thing I discovered was that the blade was jammed and had to be forced through the opening to be on the correct side of the slicer. That part was sheer guesswork because there were absolutely no use/care instructions. I tried slicing a clove of garlic which the writeup said was an option. The garlic was fresh and firm but was turned to mush by the slicer. I next tried it on an olive to see if a firmer item would work out better. The result was a scrambled olive. While the slicer looks good and appears to be well made I have had no success with it.

I prefer my smoothies to be thick and have some texture, rather than be total liquified, and the Ninja prep is perfect for this. HOWEVER....after using the system for about 3 years, I am on my third or fourth 40 oz. bowl. Why?? Because they consistently crack, and they crack mutiple times. Others have also mentioned this in their reviews. Obviously, the plastic used to make these cannot stand up to frozen ingredients, including ice. My last one had about 8 cracks...multiple fractures on the bottom and sides of the base through which contents would ooze out. So I began using my newest replacement bowl about 2 weeks ago. The second day I used it it cracked on the bottom. Yesterday, it again cracked on the bottom. It is a great disappointment, especially since Ninja is aware of this issue, but has done nothing to remedy it. A stronger grade of plastic? A glass bowl? If there was another company that made these bowls for the Ninja prep system, I would be first in line to try one. But alas, as before, I will probably have to order another from Amazon when this newest one develops too many cracks to use it safely.", "review_title": "Will Definitely Crack!", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

You also have to time it just right because it burns the bag pretty quickly if you don't move it across the bag at a consistent pace. I would not recommend anyone buy this.

I determined the cause to be a necessary software update, which then wouldn't process due to an incompatibility with a new version of iOS. Two weeks later, I got my mug updated and got to use it. My first experience was putting coffee into the mug, lid closed. I kept the liquid under the \"Fill Line\" as instructed, and when my drink reached temperature and I went to open it to drink, the lid \"popped\" violently, and sprayed liquid everywhere. If you travel with this lid and use it in the closed position, expect to have to force the lid open and have liquid spray out in all directions. It's not a rare occurrence with regular use. The experience, upon using the mug, was nothing exceptional. It would keep drinks warm for about two hours, set to a specific temperature. But, unless it's plugged into its charging pad, I've found it will occasionally \"forget\" to keep the drink warm. I'll tap the logo, the mug will light up and inform me my drink has dropped twenty degrees from where I had it set, and it has to try to warm it up. Not quite the experience I expected, but it's not a major issue. Then, the lid broke. The lid is a ring in the center of the mug, and you have to depress it, where it latches and stays open to allow you to drink. My lid broke such that the lid would no longer latch into place, and would rock off to one side or the other, so that I could either get no liquid out at all, if the lid were centered, or I could get a sporadic and slow trickle of liquid out by getting the lid stuck inside itself. I contacted them and was summarily shipped a replacement lid, and I thought perhaps it would be a fluke. I got the lid, and continued as normal. In this time, the mug would often (probably 8 times out of 10) refuse to turn on without first being touched to the charger. Again, not a great experience for a $150 coffee mug. Then, just now, my second lid broke. I'm going to have to contact customer support again, and see if they'll ship me another lid. All this has occurred since September 2017, a five-month period. Not the level of quality I would presume to get from such an expensive luxury product, but I'll have to consider this a lesson learned. I had high hopes for this product, but it would seem the Kickstarter Curse is as present as ever. It has been a considerable waste of money, energy, and time, and I do not recommend anyone buy this product, or any other product from Ember.", "review_title": "Lids will break, mug doesn't always work as you would think", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

However, I won't be ordering any more. I like the design as far as the color and the ability to keep things cold for a long time, but the lid makes it both inconvenient to drink from, and inconvenient to carry. Honestly, my water intake has decreased since I purchased this item, bc sometimes it is just too much of a hassle to mess with just to take a swallow or two. The color is amazing. The cup keeps things cold for a very long time. I put about 5 ice cubes in it and filled it up with water, and although the ice was melted when I was still drinking from it over 24 hours later, the water was still cold. BUT, the lid SUCKS. if you don't make sure the flip closure lays down flat when you open it, it closes on you before you tilt it enough to get a drink. But the problem with that is, if your holding the cup by the handle on the lid, there is not enough room to lay the closure flat (and I have skinny fingers). Which is annoying if you are walking and you have to have hold the bottle in your arm so that you can open it and take a drink, and then do it again to close it. Also, to close the flip lid fully, (clicking it into place), I have to put a lot of pressure on it, so I usually cannot hold it by the handle to do this, and honestly need to put so much pressure that it is even hard to do if I am just cradling the bottle in my arm. I pretty much need to be able to set it down, and push the flip lid pretty hard. Why am I not just using the silver screw top, you might ask? Tried that, and it leaked everywhere. , not to mention, the way it's attached is very annoying...instead of just being able to take it off and hold it, it is loosely attached to the cup rim, so loose that it moves around and you have to hold it in place while you drink, which means you need two hands to drink out of the bottle if you're using that lid, because the bottle is already almost too wide to hold with one hand regularly. (I have to hold around the bottom of the lid to get a drink without using two hands with the flip top lid). So the bottle works great if you are just storing it with water, or just sitting in one place all day. But it's not a good fit my use, which is to keep it on me at all times to stay hydrated while constantly on the go.", "review_title": "This product is okay for the price.", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

Aicok is the Black and Decker of China and has many kinds of countertop products, mostly very good quality, so I expect this to outlast our last couple of lower priced american made mixers. Good positive blade attaching and ejecting, switches and construction all first class. I think IF the blades truly are stainless steel rather than a steel rivet holding it together like my Sunbeam, I should be happy with it. Good power and balance. We also have the nice KitchenAid stand mixer for heavy duty baking and such, but sometimes you just need something you can grab quickly, use and pop the blades into a bowl to soak, so we picked this high powered unit. It does run a little fast, but that's pretty common of hand mixers these days... the big mixer can do slow beatings :)", "review_title": "Aicok is a high quality Chinese brand", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

So at current date it's about 20 months old (give or take). The machine has worked beautifully for about the first year. I use it, on average 2 or 3 times a week to blend smoothies. So mostly cutting up fruits and ice together along with other semi-liquids - peanut butter, etc. So not a significant chore and I'll say the blender cruises through the material today as good as it did during day one. A couple things I'll point out at this point that keep me from being above 3 stars. The pitcher is not scratch resistant. This is relevant to cleaning. If you use an abrasive cleaning utensil (rough side of a sponge, etc.) it will leave the glass looking foggy. Not a huge deal, but certainly makes an otherwise new pitcher look aged quickly. I used the dishwasher for the pitcher, blades, and top 90% of the time. This may be counter to what the manufacturer recommends, but for real life, I just don't think it reasonable not to use a dishwasher on a pitcher for an appliance. The bigger problem with the machine has been the durability of the pitcher and associated lid / latching mechanism. Over the past number of months I noticed the black outer part of the handle on the pitcher was coming apart from the clear acrylic portion of the underside of the handle. I figured it wasn't a big deal, just kind of annoying. Perhaps it's due to the multiple dishwasher cycles (hot water / heated dry) - I'm not sure. This became a real problem recently when the part separated enough that the lit would not fit down properly to engaged the safety switch that runs up the handle due to the handle separating. Instead the two plastic pieces (the lid latch and the separated handle) came into contact, preventing the lid latch from making contact with the lock mechanism that runs up through the handle. I was surprised/disappointed to find that this year warranty is expired (and I've seen numerous reports that the pitcher isn't covered anyway, completely) and the cost of a new pitcher is within about $10 of what I paid almost 2 years ago for the entire unit. I think I'll be more discriminating in the next blender I buy, and not sure I'd trust in Ninja for the next purchase. When dropping the kind of money they expect for these, I'd hope for at least 3-5 years of usability. In full disclosure I didn't call the company to complain or ask for a new lid. I may later, but for now I made a temporary fix myself that will get me through for a little while longer I hope. This entailed very intensive craftsmanship made up of zip ties to bind the handle back together and a dremel tool to zip off the hanging lip of the lid latch to prevent it from hitting the handle. (Even with the handle zip tied together, I couldn't get enough pressure to prevent contact). I've attached pictures to indicate what the issue was and my rudimentary (but effective, for now) patch job.", "review_title": "A solid blender, but a more durable pitcher would make it a superb appliance", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

Holes are too close to the edge of the banner so when hanging, if you try to tighten up the string, the holes break and the triangles don't hang anyway.

If you don't like it they don't do returns. My complaints only brought me time on the phone while they trouble shoot with you trying to get it right. Only problem is, the faults on this machine don't go away. If you work really hard you might get a warm cup of coffee so if you like it hot, it's not going to happen. UPDATE: After using this machine for 3 months and still getting lukewarm coffee, now the portafilter keeps getting stuck in the machine.

The packaging was unusual, in that it was written entirely in Chinese, and it wasn't sealed very well. I can't read Chinese, so I had no instructions to go by, but the cutter was easy enough to figure out. Just put the panda head piece inside the black square, with the little rounded handle poking through the hole in the square piece. Then fit the black into the white square with your sandwich in between. Don't be afraid to press very hard on the handle to the panda head, because if you don't press hard enough, you won't get a face on your sandwich. Upon opening the sealer, you should see the sandwich is mostly cut, but you may need to cut/pull away some of the crust from around the edges before removing it, so it isn't still hanging on. The resulting panda sandwich is very cute, and went over wonderfully with the 3-6 year olds at my house. I just dabbed a little peanut butter on the outside of the eyes, nose and mouth to highlight the cuteness. It would be cooler with something black in those places, but I'm not sure what that could be. In any case, my kids ask for a lot more sandwiches now than they did before we bought this, and it wasn't hard to hand wash. Really the biggest downside is the amount of bread you waste when you make sandwiches in this, but I froze the crusts as another reviewer here suggested, and I'm going to try making something with them later.", "review_title": "Makes a cute sandwich, wastes a lot of bread", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

I wrap my items sitting in the floor (hard wood flooring) I noticed that even though I was very gentle in wrapping the items, to ensure that there are no tears in the paper, I flipped the packages to notice that any section of the paper that touched the floor it was white. To test this I rubbed the paper with slight pressure with my thumb to see that the color of the paper just wiped right away and was white were I rubbed. I moved on to a rub to continue wrapping and any place I folded the paper or applied pressure when folding or taping, the part touching the rug would turn white. I really didn't expect this for hallmark quality. The cost was about what I would pay at the local department store so I'm just going to keep it.

I originally found this brand/style canister from walmart and bought a few to keep snacks accessible for my preschooler on the bottom pantry shelf. I bought them because they were easy to open and close for little hands, and you can pretty much throw them across a room and they stay intact (mom approved). The unexpected thing I loved about them was how the food always stayed fresh. Nothing got stale in these things. At some point my pantry acquired a moth infestation, and these containers were the only thing the damn moths couldn\u2019t get into. For months I tried to get rid of the moths and nothing was working. So I finally decided to just buy LOTS more of these snapware canisters and put everything from my pantry into them, in an attempt to get the moths under control. (Cereal, pasta, nuts, flours, sugar all of it). I couldn\u2019t find them at walmart anymore so I bought two of these sets from amazon. YES the rubber seals were wonky-looking right out of the package, but as soon as I put them on the lids and screwed the lids in, the rubber seals straightened out and sealed into place. I don\u2019t know what you people are doing wrong but the seals work fine. You must be taking one look at them out of the box and getting disgruntled and returning before even trying to fit them on properly (which isn\u2019t hard). After washing them and putting all my foodstuffs in them, I haven\u2019t seen a single moth flying around the pantry. After a months\u2019 long battle with them, the problem was solved overnight. I was so happy I ordered a third set because there were still a few items in my pantry that were in bags. The third set was great too, seals were all fine. I just came on here to order a fourth set, and decided to take the time to write this review because despite what some others are saying, these work GREAT. Yes, the plastic is thinner than it is on some of the other more expensive products, HOWEVER, I consider this to be an advantage. Why? Go pull out one of your thick, hard plastic tupperware containers, go outside and throw it like a football into your street. You know what will likely happen? It will crack. If you throw one of these lighter canisters it would likely just bounce off the ground and remain intact because of the slight flexibility in the plastic (my small children have tested my theory and it holds).

I\u2019m a simple person and didn\u2019t want anything too flashy so went with the square block design. Upon initial use, everything was great. Seemed strong and sturdy as utensils and no rust or anything. However, the handles, I\u2019ve come to realize, are very square at the end that if you hold the utensil near the end and put any small amount of force on it, they really dig into your skin and hurt quite a lot. After some time of use, I did notice some rusting starting to happen. All the reviews mentioning rust are true. Yes, this is a relatively cheap set of silverware but if you want a decent set that you won\u2019t be throwing out anytime soon and that won\u2019t hurt the palms of your hands when you\u2019re really trying to dig into some ice cream, I\u2019d suggest getting something else. If, however, you are the person to lose silverware fairly easy or you don\u2019t really care about the hand thing and just want a cheap pair that\u2019ll last a few months, this might just do the trick.

The wooden (faux wood?) handles heat up a bit when in use, but that can be worked around without necessarily needing an oven mit. It's pretty light which is nice when pouring, but does not inspire confidence that it will last for years and years. However, I don't know that one should expect much in the way of longevity from a $20 teapot. Overall, it suites my particular needs and I feel it was a good buy.", "review_title": "Good for the money", "language": "en", "product_category": "kitchen"}

It is slightly better than the previous one. As seen in the pictures, the amount of toasting on setting 2.5 is uneven on both sides. I'm disappointed in Breville as most of their products are quite good. Remedy. I toast on setting 1.5, turn the toast, then once again on setting 1.5. That provides an evenly browned toast on both sides. Original This is to document a failure out of the box. This will be replaced through Amazon. The fault was lack of browning on one side of the bread. One side was very nice and the other lacked sufficient toasting.
