Build quality is much better than expected for a lesser-known tool company. Battery life is more than adequate, and the saw cuts quite large trees with very little effort. Also, it's very quiet with comparable performance to a gas powered mid-range model. Unless you're professionally logging, this should be all you need. The only reason I dropped a star for value is because a spare/replacement 4Ah battery costs about 2/3 of the tool with battery, and although I'm contemplating upgrading my aging Black and Decker 20V yard tools to some of the other WEN 40V yard tools, they only come with that 2Ah battery (except the mower, which I don't need). I bought this chainsaw in response to a giant tree of heaven that fell from my property onto my neighbors after our last big storm. The tree was probably about 40-50 feet long, with several 12\" or so thick trunks. I charged the battery fully before use, and spent approximately 10 minutes setting up the saw and adding oil, in no rush whatever. Super easy, and although not necessary for me, it came with one of the best-written manuals I've seen in a while for an inexpensive tool. I took it out back the following morning (today) and proceeded to chop over half the mangled mess of tree into manageable firewood lengths in about an hour. The saw easily took less effort and time to operate than moving the wood. The battery read half charge by the time I cleared the 30 or so feet that I was removing from the neighbors lawn and decided to call it quits. Very satisfied with my purchase so far. Side note: doesn't quite have the same effect as the gas powered models when you chase people around with it.

Cutting on the highest length, the 4ah battery only lasted about 15 minutes. I bought a 4ah and 2ah battery with a trimmer based on the quoted run times where an hour is all I'd need. As it is, I eat through the batteries faster than they can get any meaningful charge (5 minutes isn't enough for anything) and have to stop mowing to simply allow the batteries to charge. I'd need at least three batteries and two chargers and swap every 10 minutes to work continuously. My suggestion is to stick with gas if you have the type of grass that people compliment. Very disappointed considering the cost. Edit: At the close of the 2019 cutting season, we're still using the mower because I'm too cheap to buy another mower. It's held up well and we can accomplish mowing with two 4ah and a single 2ah battery (normally without charging required). Due to the thickness, it takes almost twice as long as a gas mower simply because it isn't as powerful and will bog down and not cut (note that I came from the gas size they say is equivalent - not at all true). It does a lot better if bagging - just stinks at mulching. Still wish I never made the mower purchase, but the other tools in the line are good. At least it is quiet and doesn't smell while also requiring only blade maintenance.

I chose this tube over some of the others because it specifically said it was 304 SS. The competitors said only stainless steel so I would have expected them to be magnetic.

My friend agreed to help me and it took us about and hour and a half to assemble. There were a couple of false starts involving using the wrong screws in the wrong places. After that our only problem was that instead of sending me a front right leg and a back right leg, both legs were identical, so we would not be able to assemble the wheels. Fortunately, my friend has a center punch and a drill press, so I wasn't forced to wait for the vendor to replace the leg I needed. As far as using the grill, it did a great job smoking a pork shoulder, cooking hamburgers and brats, and cooking a rack of baby back ribs. I did not expect the mess it makes. A lot of greasy ash is left in the bottom of the chamber. (Hint: do not use your household vacuum cleaner to get the ash out.) Having only used gas and charcoal before and having spent more for this grill than any I've ever owned, I wanted to keep it in tip top shape so I've been cleaning it after every couple of uses. Gas is cleaner, although you have the drip pan to deal with and of course the cooking grate itself. The thing is with this kind of grill, you have additional devices inside the chamber. The drip shelf is meant to be wrapped (instructions said \"warp\") in aluminum file and that helps somewhat, but it still needs a little cleaning. The heat dispersion thing-a-ma-jig gets covered with ash so it needs to be cleaned. Overall, the cooking's the thing and this works better than anything I've ever had. Temperature control is very easy and accurate.", "review_title": "Pleased first time wood pellet grill user but there are a couple of drawbacks", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

The main drawback here is that wood and charcoal do not stay lit in this product when you're cooking low and slow, even when you burn them on high with the door open for 20 mins or so with the door open, before turning down the heat and closing the door. You have to be up around 300 degrees consistently for coals or wood to stay lit, too hot for brisket, short ribs, smoked fish, you name it!

However the connectors certainly do not work very well. The part of the connector that attaches to the wire is not the issue. The problem lies where the connector attaches to the tape. The way this part works is by the pins in the connector punching through the bottom side of the tape in order to make a connection to the copper on the top of the tape. Even with the sticky back removed the pins making contact with the copper is very hit or miss. I found the only way I can get a solid connection is to remove the silicon top of the tape and placing it on the bottom of the tape and install the tape upside down in the clip. I found that this gave me a solid connection each time with out failure. This method certainly negates the waterproof aspect at the connector, but is works.", "review_title": "Wire is fine.

It's not my first, but it's been a decade or so since I went all lawn-retro and this thing is even better than my first time...so to speak. Thing to realize about using a push-reel mower is that a) you kinda hafta have mostly bermuda grass, b) you have to have your lawn pretty much under control to begin with, and c) there's no such thing as mowing too much. Like, with a regular gas mower, you feel stupid running over stuff you mowed a couple days ago, but with a push-reel mower, that's not only a good thing, but you can probably actually see the clippings flying. Which makes you feel significantly less stupid. That being said, it's got the same problem my first one had. See, in these mowers, the cutting height is controlled by the height of the back wheels, or rollers, or whatever. Rollers, in this one. They're mounted on little plastic legs that, for reasons known only to push-reel mower designers, only have one bolt apiece to hold them on to the chassis of the mower. Basic physics will tell ya that a single bolt that isn't placed at the exact point of stress will result in sideways shear force on the plastic leg, and it does, and the manufacturer's answer is to put a little lip on the soft plastic leg, which does basically nothing after the first time you hit deep grass because the metal chassis cuts straight through the little plastic lip like that's what it was made for. The upshot is, hey, ALL these mowers have this problem. But it IS a problem. So, take my advice and invest in a couple extra 5/16 bolts, make 'em say 1 3/4 inches long, and then put a second bolt through each stupid little plastic roller leg. This will prevent it from pivoting around the first bolt, and let it deal with the sideways torque, and voila, as them French say, you will now be able to apply actual shoving force to the handle without discovering your mower suddenly defaulting to cutting at 1/2 inch when you'd set it to 2 inches. Your grass will thank you. All of that being said, I still give the sucka 4 stars. I mean, it does what it says it'll do better than gas mowers that cost twice as much.

It burns quickly and efficiently, turning a days worth of work into just a few hours of burning. However, the claim that it is rust resistant is definitely NOT true. Within a year, it quickly rusts out. I burn in this 2 to 3 times a week - household papers, small trash, cardboard, yard scraps. Apx. one year of burning - 2 to 3 times a week is all I seem to get out of it. It rusts quickly - then by month 8 to 10 the handles fall off first. The side handles went first, then the lid handle. So I am hooking a rake into the holes in the lid in order to remove it while it's hot. Just like I had to do with the last barrel. The lid won't last much longer, as the holes and the edges are starting to split and crack. The sides are also weakening as the rust overtakes the metal. If this one goes like the last one, in about a month, I'm going to need a new barrel. It's okay for the price. Just be forewarned - rust will take it out in about a year. I'm going to try painting the next one with heat resistant Rustoleum grill paint next time and see if that extends the life of the barrel.", "review_title": "Burns quickly and efficiently - but definitely NOT rust proof.", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

I've used various home made contraptions over the years to make the poison blocks available to mice but not to other critters, while keeping the poison protected from rain etc. Figured I'd give the Tomcat Rodent Station a try, since that is pretty much what it's made for. It's a decent sized plastic box - the overall dimensions are about right for outdoor use. It's big enough that it won't blow away in the wind or get lost under snow. And it holds 4 bait blocks, which is plenty. So it gets the job done. I have several nits to pick though: 1) It is nigh on IMPOSSIBLE to open. The supplied key is completely useless. You'll need 2 large flathead screwdrivers or something similar - one to pry it open with and the other to hold it open as you pry a little more. It is unnecessarily difficult to say the least! I get that the point is to keep kids and pets from gaining access to poison, but c'mon... Can't they come up with a better design that that? 2) Bait blocks not included. Which makes this a little bit expensive, considering it is really just a plastic box. 3) It includes 4 metal rods, which can hold the bait blocks in a vertical position and keep them from falling out if the box gets jostled. That's great, but my bait blocks (despite being Tomcat brand) are not drilled with holes to receive the rods. The picture on the box indicates that Tomcat does make drilled bait blocks, but I don't know where to buy them. So for me, the rods are pretty much useless.", "review_title": "Difficult to open.

The instructions are worthless, but my main gripe is it's not ready to plug and play. You have to spend another $50 or so for the parts they don't include. The tubing for the input, output to the pond, and sludge drain. You can probably use the same size tubing for the intake and the sludge drain, but then you have to buy another size for the output back to the pond, or use pvc elbows, tubes, glue, and all of that is before you can even test it to see if it works. I ordered the 1 1/2\" tubing from Amazon before I realized I needed the output 3\" either tubing or pvc fittings and tubes. So now a week later as I will have to schedule a trip to the hardware store, it's still not running. When I buy a filter, I don't mind the normal hook up, but expect all of the needed parts and equipment to be there along with instructions that are understandable for installation. Very disappointing for this kind of money. Get a 5 year old for the instructions and pictures.

I spoke with them multiple times and everyone I talked too had really good customer service. So far we\u2019re really happy, the filter is working extremely well and our pool is crystal clear. I\u2019m updating the review from 1 star to 4.

It has only been a few days but the roots have already started to attach. I am using a rubber band for the moment to keep the plant in firm contact with the pole. The roots have started to attach but it is too soon to expect them to support the plant on their own. This is a very effective way to add some vertical support for your pothos. I do not like my pothos to spill down to the floor. To me, it looks better when the plant is climbing vertically. This pole will make it easy to do that without having to nail a trellis to your living room wall! All you need do is insert the metal supports down into the soil and it is strong enough to hold itself up. That said, because the steel supports will need to dig deep into the soil, you need a deep plant pot. Do not attempt to use this on a shallow plant pot. Use a tall, deep pot that holds a large amount of soil in order to hold the metal supports firmly. Use common sense. Moisten the material but do not keep it soggy. You will need some way to hold your pothos to the pole until the roots can firmly attach themselves. Zip ties are too hard, in my opinion. They can damage the plant. I use rubber bands. The rubber will eventually deteriorate and break off. You can also use cotton threads, which will eventually rot away. Rubber bands are the easiest. My pole was slightly bent when it arrived. I do not know if it came out of the factory that way or from the shipping. It's not a big deal because the pothos will eventually cover the pole. The product came in a plastic package. The sharp ends of the metal supports were wrapped in cardboard. Please, be careful when handling the metal supports. The two metal rods do not look sharp but they can easily do damage to your eyes. You do not want to fall on your potted plant because the metal supports are sharp on both ends. Be careful with your pets. Do not stab yourself with the metal supports. I would have preferred thick plastic supports to thin metal rods for better safety. This product is excellent, but beware the two metal support rods. It would have easily gotten a five star rating if the rods had been made of plastic or some type of material that cannot poke you or your animals. I highly recommend this product.

It is very sturdy, and it folds up into a sufficiently small space that it easily fits into the trunk without using the entire space. What I do not like is that the handle is very short. So am I, and it\u2019s a problem for me, let alone my 6\u2019 husband. There is a cover that fits over the folded wagon, and from the picture I assumed that I could wheel it back down to the car using the handle on top of this cover. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the case, as the wheels wobble so much that it falls over every few steps (actually, the wheels wobble somewhat even when I\u2019m toting the loaded wagon). The upshot is that I have to fold it up and carry it down to the car to refit to the trunk. I find that I avoid using it on occasions when I would have opened that grocery cart to carry the load I had. Because this wasn\u2019t a cheap product and because I gave my grocery cart way, I\u2019ll keep it. I want to emphasize again, however, that this wagon is very sturdy and well made.", "review_title": "I like the fact that this wagon carries a lot and ...", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

The lights are awesome and it runs off a regular electrical outlet. Two major problems that I have with this. Number one is the controls are hard to figure out. Even after reading the manual it still gets confusing with all the different types of mode plus there are things you figure out along the way as to why your hot tub isn't heating up, trying to find the correct setting on how many people will be in it to how much it is going to be used, need to really read up on chemicals that need to be in it and where to buy those along with the filters. this hot tub does get on stuck mode quite a bit. You have to be careful changing the different modes on it because if your temp is too high it may think it needs to be heated if your temperature setting is on low. For example, you have it set for 98 degrees but then you decide that you want it cooler to 95. If you are in economy mode and it is over 95 degrees then the hot tub will run non stop no matter what setting or filteration setting it is on. The main issue I have with this hot tub is the Hudson Bay customer service. I was on the phone with them for a total of a week trying to figure out why my hot tub was not turning off and why some of my jets were not working. I fear that if I ever have to order parts and have them installed it just will not happen with this company. I kept asking for someone to come out and look at it but I kept getting the run around. As for ordering any parts of the company I was told by the service department that I would be better off buying my parts such as chemicals and filters from someplace else because they were way to expensive and shipping time can be as long as a month after I placed my order. I was finally able to talk to someone in the service department that was able to explain to me how to fix stuff and to check stuff but it took me a forever to find him. Average length of phone call was 3 hours where they just kept telling me to do the same thing over and over again. Very frusterating. So if you do not need customer service at all then feel free to buy this hot tub.", "review_title": "Customer Service is SO bad that I would of never bought this directly from the company itsself, Hudson Bay", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

Also noticed that it really takes a lot more pressure to work these than the ones I was replacing because of ware due to age, but I like the old ones better. And even though they are not as good as they were when they were new, I still prefer using them over these new ones.", "review_title": "NOT THE BEST CUTTING DESIGN", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

I purchased this chair in 2017 and like it so much that i asked my family to buy a 2nd one for me as a birthday gift this year. I sent my family the link from my order 2 years ago and they purchased it for me. But what arrived is not the same chair at all. I don't think there is a single part on the chair that is the same as the one from 2017. The brackets are thinner. The bolts are silver (as opposed to the brown ones previously that matched). The holes for the bolts don't line up causing the new chair to be crooked and putting pressure on the bolts. The cushions are smaller and more square (cheaper looking). The arms, legs, rockers, backrest, and seat are thinner. The vinyl is wrapped looser. The reinforcement under the seat has fewer straps to hold up the seat. Bait And Switch. The product has changed substantially and the company is taking advantage of years of good reviews but delivering a different product. Bait And Switch. Ive reported this to Amazon. As of today, the 5 pics at the top of the listing are of the chair i received 2 years ago. However, lower in the detailed From The Manufacturer section, the more current chair is pictured.

It does cut fast and I like that I'm not spreading plastic all over my property. The blades are stamped out and not sharpened but cut pretty good anyway.

Part of their body or their wings need to touch for them to be trapped. 2) Having it on during the day doesn't seem to do much... they prefer the natural daylight by the windows to the trap, so trusty ol fly swatters have to do the trick until nightfall. 3) It is slightly frustrating that the plug doesn't rotate.

This one is not the answer. First, the bottom is too rounded, not flat enough. The tube that holds the umbrella tube grabs okay but since it is NOT secured to the base, the umbrella spins with the slightest breeze. Even filled with water, it tips over with no more than a gentle breeze. I am going to try sand and water mix but this stand is very unstable as is. I am adding another caution...my umbrella has a tilt function.

The collars stop about 6 inches from the front of the rocker arm in the chairs full open position. They are collars so they surround the entire circumference of the rocker arm (like a nut on a bolt), so when the chair is rocking toward the front, it hits this collar and stops the forward motion. Its not a little bump either its a dead STOP and there is no forward motion beyond that point!! Therefore, if you have short legs you will rock toward the front with VERY limited motion.

I found this little item instead. I paired this with a Masterbuilt Sportsman Elite smoker and I have something very similar to the Bradley at about 1/2 the price. The neat thing about this item is that you can really do a cold smoke. Just attach this to your smoker with a 3\" flex dryer vent and the smoke generator will be a couple of feet from the smoker. By the time the smoke gets into the smoker, it is about the ambient air temp. In fact, I smoked cheese the other day and the temp inside was just 35 degrees -- about the same as the outside temp. Another advantage to this is that it uses regular wood chips which are a lot cheaper and available than the Bradley wood biscuits. The only negative I have had with this is that you periodically need to make sure the wood chips in the chip holder are not sticking together. Because of its design, the chips are in a column directly above the heating element. The idea is that as the chips burn, the ones above continually fall onto the heating element, turn to ash (which falls into the ash pan) and then are replaced by the ones above. In practice, as the chips burn, the ones above sometimes stick together and don't fall on the heating element. You know when this happens because the amount of smoke generated is very light. The solution is to take something like a long screwdriver or knife and poke the chips in in the holder, breaking the jam and allowing them to feed properly. This is one area where the Bradley is better designed and doesn't have this problem. But with a little manual effort, you can have a versatile smoke generator at a much lower cost.", "review_title": "A very good Smoke Generator for the price.", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

There are sharp pieces of the rivet sticking out that can grab you (i did scratch myself a few times). Very dangerous as it's very sharp. Another thing is one corner of the shovel where you put your foot has a very fine point and can scratch/cut you if not careful. The shovel has scratches on it but I don't care about that, it's a shovel afterall. But the portion where you may grab, having very sharp metal fragments from the rivet? That's just bad bad bad. I wonder if people got a free shovel for raving reviews or got a lot of money back in exchange for a big review. I sell on amazon and get companies who do just that so ya never know. But this is an honest persons review. It's a shovel, it's a good size, has a good feel but has a bunch of dangerous points where you can really hurt yourself.

The oring seals are just a bit too small causing a leak. I disassembled the swivel and installed slightly thicker orings. The leak was reduced but still present. Turns out the threads on the swivel are parallel and not tapered the same as a standard pipe thread. This means I will now need to disassemble the swivel one more time to apply liquid pipe sealant to the threads to fully seal it up. If you\u2019re using the reel outside, solid 4.5 stars.

Transformer itself cannot withstand rain water!\". They are outside lights, so I don't understand why they have to be out of the weather. We put something over top of the supply to keep it dry until we can figure out what to do. I'm going to try and contact the company again. I'm really not sure how to rate the lights.

When I went to adjusted the \"mode\" button so that they lights would stay \"on\" , as opposed to blinking on and off, the lights would NOT stay on unless the little black control box was in a certain position. If i put the box down or moved it then the lights went \"off\" There must have been a loose wire. There were two sets of string lights in each box, and I had the same situation with the second string of lights.

But Amazon return process was just short of a nightmare. I had to call amazon 4 times to get everything picked up. They kept only providing 1 return slip for all 5 boxes and kept telling me it was ok. However, UPS wanted 5 unique return slips for each box. I took off of work to be home for the pickup appointment time, but UPS was never notified the first time. So I took off of work and sat home for nothing. I'm still happy with my purchase and really like the set. EDIT: Firepit no longer works, stays lit for 3 minutes then fades out. It appears to be an issue with the dial What I like: Everything was delivered in 3 days and none of the boxes were destroyed. Everything was easy to put together. The chairs seem to be well made, I like how the 2 cushions velcro together to stay in place. The firepit look nice, maybe a little more attention to detail could have been used. But that's just nitpicking. I like how the firepit and side table/tank holder have adjustable feet to make level. What I didn't like: I had serious issues trying to get the fire pit to light. At first I thought I had too much lava rocks, so I removed all. Then I thought I had an issue with my tank and swapped it with my grill tank to be sure. Then I thought I had an issue with the propane gas line connections. Then I thought I had issues with the dial on the firepit. Apparently you have to press the dial in once you turn it to on, then hit the lighter. I was just turning the dial on and clicking the lighter and nothing was happening. I also don't like that it's $60 cheaper today than when I purchased it 3 days ago. In summary, I'm happy with my purchase. And I'm glad that I also purchased covers for everything as to keep it from sun fading.", "review_title": "Nice outdoor furniture set", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

They work great, while still thin enough for a door to glide across them if used inside. The color options are misleading, as some other reviewers have said. If you're trying to match decor, you may consider looking at other rugs. But if color does not matter much, the utility of these mats deserves consideration. I ordered gray which is frankly a blue-ish color. No worries in my case, as they are used in the garage. They do their job well -- clean dirty, wet shoes and dog paws! The mats clean well too. A stiff broom or vacuum gets the grit out. They hold up well to a beating against the wall for removing sand. A hose and water get mud off well. Weight is worth noting. There are similar rugs with a heavier plastic backing...the underside. I will say, the light weight of the backing on these mats can make them scoot on the floor, while heavier alternatives stay put better. But if you're looking for a thin, waterproof backing with enough fluff to keep floors cleaner and drier, give these a shot ... just don't get picky on color!

From my experience it does allow pass through charging (so you can charge it and use it to power something else at the same time) which is great but i only had it powering a small fan and it essentially held the same percentage charge without change while plugged into my wall which is an ideal scenario so i can't imagine it powering anything so well with a solar panel. The I/O is pretty decent and well laid out and the digital read out is pretty nice but the downside is that even tho this whole thing is a matte finish plastic the I/O area is all a really SOFT shiny plastic. most electronics come with a protective film barrier you can peel off and really take in the brand new perfect just out of the box view of your new toy then scratch it up yourself over a long period of time, this came out of the box all scratched up and looking like a beat up floor model at some random store within arms reach of little kids who love to destroy things. And upon inspection it is REALLY easy to add more scratches and gouges just with bare fingers and nails. Looking back i wish i would have gone with my gut and just returned it then. Now i spend more time thinking about what i could use it for than ever actually using it. But if all you need is emergency portable charging for phone's, tablets, laptop, fans, etc then sure it's not bad. Honestly i'm having a hard time finding a use for this thing, for normal every day battery emergencies its too big for convenience so you probably won't have it on you anyway, and i just end up using my small 10,000mah battery packs cuz they're pocket size and can be used anywhere like work in a front pocket, desk or locker. for real battery emergencies like car or motorcycle it doesn't help either, even tho i had this thing with me at the time, there's no way to jump start or charge even my tiny motorcycle battery with this model and i was left stranded. for flashlight emergency, i just use a flashlight. if driving i just use car chargers. if i'm too far from an outlet i can get a longer charging cord or power strips or extension cords. if i need to power anything on a more permanent basis with back up there are better options like for cpap machines, computers, fridges, etc. if it's living out of a van you're after then solar panel the roof and make your own battery array.. if it's big camping we just ended up using the RV's generator for everything, for average camping and really need power get a decent whisper quiet gas generator and maybe use this over night to have some silent power if you chronically forget to charge phones during the day, for light camping or even hiking it would probably be pretty good for an all around power source if you don't mind the extra weight. but even for longer motorcycle rides were i would like to use this in a backpack or saddle bag to keep things 100% the i'd be worried about the I/O arrangement on the front, i imagine i'd be snapping off cables pretty often with all the right angle plugs on the front instead of it all being protected behind a trap door like on some models, and the soft plastic across the front will eventually make all the labels unreadable through the haze of scratches. i had hopes for this thing but i've run into a lot of road blocks, it's decent power for the price but basically for any application i can imagine i'd either go much bigger or much smaller. i guess it's pretty nice for what it is, but for what it is i also never use it. It'll probably end up as a surprise gift to a family member and i'll see what they come up with for it. =)", "review_title": "For the money, i really wish it had more versatility.

Additional sealing is preferred for the main door, smoke rolls out from all directions without it. For the price, I'm thrilled with it. If a hurricane carried it off, I would buy another one.

Perhaps I'm expecting too much from these systems. I live in upstate New York where it snows. I purchased this system to be able to see more than just outdoor temperature and humidity. When it snows (which is pretty much all winter) the anemometer and wind vane get covered in snow and can't turn. Therefore, I am not able to see wind speed or direction in the winter. Also, the solar panel is covered in snow many inches deep. So, I guess the only additional parameter I can see that is not available from the cheap temp/humidity sensors is barometric pressure. I'm hoping for better functionality in the summer. Although a manual is included, it does not give enough information about the display. For example, the wind gust indicator (yes, I was able to see wind speed for a few days before it snowed) does not indicate the time window. Is that the biggest gust in the past hour? day? since midnight? The book does not explain. There is an up/down arrow next to the barometric pressure, which I am assuming indicates if the pressure is rising or falling--a reasonable assumption, but the book does not explain. There is in addition a number next to it which, again I'm assuming means the change in pressure over some period of time. What period? There is just not enough explanation. The engineer or technical writer who put the manual together did not put themselves in the mindset of a customer who does not know what they know. I'm an engineer and write manuals to explain my products. I will occasionally get a customer ask a question, and I will direct them to the answer in the manual. I understand that most people do not want to read manuals these days, but some do, and the information should be there. The lack of explanation in the manual is not the reason for lack of 5 stars. I had hoped this weather station would function in snowy weather. Do not mount this where you cannot get to it to clear the snow regularly.

The full manual is on line. e.g. When you set the start time, the number indicator is for one of four start times per day. It is NOT the station number. All stations run consecutively on every start time if a duration is set. This is in the full manual not the manual shipped with the unit. As a result, I almost threw this thing away when it ran 16 times on one day on one program! But the fine print sent me on-line to get the thing to work. The comments on the orbit web site are that this is a non intuitive device! End of important comment. Looks good so far, easy enough to program though you should keep THE manual. Operations is not at all intuitive unless you already owned one of these. Some buttons have two labels (enter/manual). You have to cycle through modes to get to the mode you want (e.g. manual water individual stations.) But, if you just try them all, you will find what you want sooner or later. I took off one star for the non-intuitive interface. This is an outdoor controller. Thus it limits the openings to the controller. That is good. But installing it is a bear. I am a grown man. Trying to get my adult fingers in the sideways crook to access the common left me cursing. That cost them another star. The indoor Rainbird is easier to install but it is indoor which is where you should put this Orbit anyway. You can't leave this Orbit outdoors in the sun or rain either.

So I pulled the trigger on this. First impressions were \" hmm,. not bad\"-- BUT-- This item is NOT the quality of a Lodge or Griswold- casting is rough, unfinished, extremely dirty and totally unacceptable to use out of the box. The \"seasoned\" baking pan I received had so much questionable black gunk on it, I took some coarse emery paper to the whole inside of the pan. I spent a good hour hand sanding down to bare metal and was shocked at how much black unknown material came off ( about a 3rd of a cup). After seasoning it was safe to use. If you do purchase this be prepared- old clothes and rubber gloves. You will end up with this all over you when sanding- better yet I should have taken this over to my buddies house and just sandblasted it clean. It is NOT ready to use out of the box.

It has rollers and no bristles. So it\u2019s just designed to pick stuff up, not scrub. I saw this model on a YouTube video and it specifically mentioned it was great for vinyl pools. Based on the triangular shape, I also thought it would get into corners easier. I used it today for the first time. I started in the deep end, 12 feet, and the first thing I noticed was how difficult it was to push along the bottom. I really had to fight with it which made it difficult to maneuver in any logical pattern to ensure full covered. Once while trying to pull it towards me, the pole came loose from the attachment arm. I decided perhaps the extreme angle of the pole was making it difficult to push so I moved to the shallow end. This did help a bit but it was still a lot of work to move it across the bottom surface. I believe the problem here was more that it was suctioning itself to tight to the bottom. In addition, it\u2019s not flexible like my rectangular head and will not transition well from the side to the bottom, which is curved. After struggling with this for as long as it usually take me to vacuum the entire pool, I had a partially and randomly vacuumed pool. I switched back to the rectangular head and it was so much easier. Anyway, just thought I\u2019d try something new (and it\u2019s pretty cool looking) but for my needs, this head is not the proper solution.", "review_title": "Might work well for some, but not for me.", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

It\u2019s stylish enough that my wife uses it even when wearing a dress, and it\u2019s neutral enough that I don\u2019t mind carrying it. The zippers are very strong. The fabric is durable. The back is padded just enough, and the reinforced bottom means the bag usually stays upright. And it\u2019s very comfortable to carry. We haven\u2019t had any problems with the straps. But the snap broke off within the first month of use. The snap was a futile design anyways \u2014 if the bag or pocket are full, it\u2019s hard to snap it. Not that we like that pocket anyways, because of you leave it unzipped and flip the top over, everything comes out. And we too have had the same problem with the side pocket tearing off. Unfortunately the pocket tore just after the 90-day warranty expired. The issue with the side pockets is that they\u2019re not gusseted \u2014 they\u2019re cut to the same size as the side panel width. So if the bag is full, the pocket doesn\u2019t have any flexibility, and the seam isn\u2019t reinforced. Also, this will barely zip with a 15\u201d MacBook when empty, and it doesn\u2019t zip if you\u2019re packing anything else with the laptop too. I don\u2019t trust that the back straps are strong enough to hold up over time, but so far they\u2019ve been great and comfortable. Not sure that we\u2019d buy it again until those features are redesigned, but because it\u2019s exactly the same dimensions as a free personal item for European flights, it did pay for itself instead of paying for a carry-on bag.", "review_title": "Stylish, comfortable, but prone to tearing when maxed out", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

The soil they were in was absolutely soaked so thoroughly that if the plants sat at the post office one extra day, I'd be very very concerned about root rot. I'll admit that two leaves left on each plant (literally two leaves on each plant) does look very healthy, but it's going to take these plants quite a bit of time and TLC to get growing again, and after they stabilize and grow out, it will take a bit of time after that for them to begin blooming. So these roses are definitely a bit of a DIY situation. These are NOT the kind of plant you give for gifts, or starter plants to get you going with gardening. You'd be much better off going to your local nursery/garden center and starting out there. I love Drift roses (they do well in container gardens in the humid, hot Florida climate) and they are difficult to find locally, so I order them online. I order a ton of plants online, and I have to say that the four drift roses (coral, peach, apricot, and popcorn) have all arrived in really bad condition when compared to all of the other plants I have ordered in my eight years gardening. But the last two Drift roses I ordered bounced back within two or three months, and I really *love* them, so I went ahead and got the coral and peach to add to my collection. The first two looked like they got torched with fire, and then these two came completely bald, so none of the four arrived in good condition. But, like I said, I think with a bit of TLC, an immediate repot (get them out of that soggy soil and plastic container ASAP!) and some patience, the Drift roses do tend to bounce back. Just be ready to do some digging and repotting and tending to when they arrive- don't leave them sitting in the box a few days.", "review_title": "do not arrive in great condition, but tend to bounce back nicely", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

I can say that this thing really rocks with power--close to a gasoline trimmer power. Tall weeds that would bog down my 20V trimmer are no problem for it. Yard is done in half the time. Two downsides: the edge trimming function is difficult to use. The 20V B&D trimmer had wheels to aid edge trimming, but this one just has a metal U shaped bar. Takes some getting used to and not nearly as smooth. Also, the way the trimmer is held is different from most: you sort of use your forearm to counterbalance the trimmer rather than holding its weight with the palm of your hand.

Two weeks later, another string of lights did the same thing. Unfortunately I don't have extras of these white remote receivers, so my room is only partially lit up now.

I wish I could give it less. Awful customer service. Had to file a claim with Amazon, who, fortunately, is working to assist and make it right.

My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake.

While it adhered to my RV just fine, it's the backing against the lights themselves that pulls free. The silicone design of the lights is \"slick\", so over the course of a week it started to pull away from the side where the plug was located, and gradually kept pulling away from the surface until over half of it was no longer attached. At that juncture, I abandoned hope and pulled the lights off my RV. I plan to reinstall using a higher quality adhesive and see if that remedies the problem. I'm hoping this was just a bad batch of adhesive, though, as it appeared to be 3M tape, and I usually find their products excellent. Now, for the positives: The lights illuminated our awning perfectly and provided more than sufficient lighting without an obnoxious intensity. The adjustment available with the dimmer proved to be very useful as well, and when we'd retire for the night, I'd leave them on, but lit dimly so that any midnight runs to the campground bathroom would be lighted. They're very thin and unintrusive, almost invisible if you don't know to look for them. I also noticed that the ends accomodate expansion as they contain an exposed positive and negative wire. I considered hardwiring these in using that feature, but then I would lose the dimmable aspect. Overall, it's a great product. If that adhesive would have help up, this would have been a 5-star review", "review_title": "If it stuck properly, it'd be perfect", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

This has happened with both peanut butter and cheese. Very frustrating. I have used eight of these traps without any success. Update: Finally caught a mouse using these traps. The key was to lubricate the activation lever mechanism with some canola oil prior to putting cheese on the pedal. That night I caught a mouse with the lubricated trap. I raised the rating to four stars. These traps are made in china, and the quality control is poor. Roughly half of these traps will not fire due to the pedals having too wide a lip that goes over the metal release bar. I fixed some of them using pliars. But the lubrication worked well so I recommend that solution.", "review_title": "Insensitive. Mouse just eats the bait and moves on to the next trap.

My old trimmer lasted about 12 years and I had all the attachments so I wanted to stay with the same brand. Bottom line is that this is not a good product. The engine is extremely cold natured meaning that without the electric starter you can forget it starting before you end up with blisters from the pull cord. Once it warms up (and it takes a while) it is not half bad. But the killer is the trimmer head and trying to restring it. I'm not an angry or violent man, but just yesterday I had to walk away after 20 minutes before I just smashed this thing to pieces. The instructions are completely wrong....there is physically no way to string this thing as they say as the string cannot pass through. The old head was a bit of a pain, but it worked. This you have to take a screwdriver, pry (i.e., bend the heck out of it) to get it apart and then you have to wind both sides (one on top, one on bottom), then pray that you can line it back up and snap it back together. It's probably a two to three person job to be honest. When you get it started and warmed up and it's got a full head it works. It's just frustrating to spend more time putting string in this thing than actually time spent using it.

The tick did not seem interested in or get stuck in the fibers, as claimed. However, it did eventually start turn upside down (and back right side up) a few times and look generally unhappy. As it looked like it was about dead I took it off (to see if it would revive) and it did not, it was dead dead. The whole process took about 4 minutes. If in this 4 minutes, one of those flips caused it to fall off my leg, that would be fine, I would not care if it was dead or not. But I am still not sure how long it would take to climb from bottom to top and whether it would be exposed to enough permethrin to cause it to fall off in that time, or to fall off after it climbed above the gaiter (and onto me!)

It was a great cover made of premium material (felt like the heavy lead blankets dentist puts on you during X-rays). I bought another Weber cover in 2014 but that was junk and fell apart in a year. Frustrating because Weber still charged a premium for their cover which was clearly no longer a \u201cpremium\u201d product (quick google search and you\u2019ll find that Weber no longer makes the same premium cover that lasted me 10+ years, even though they still charge the premium price).

My style of gardening is to lay down weed block on one day and get some bags of mulch another day.

I would sit out everyday and drink my coffee looking at new mounds that had popped up over night. I saw this trap reviewed on Mouse Trap Mondays and thought \"That is what I need!!!\" I ordered it and was very excited to use it. I took it out to the yard and found what appeared to be a fresh mound and found the tunnel.....It was only about 1/2\" below the surface. I tried to put the trap in and it just kept falling over. I propped it up and just could not catch anything. I was pretty bummed after several failed attempts. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I was under my house and found another ole had been tunneling under my pier blocks. This is not good. I found a fresh pile near the side of the house which was much deeper than the other moles. I set the trap and within 30 minutes I had it. I did some reading and found that moles can cover up to 3 acres so I was hopeful they were the same mole. I went in the yard and knocked down all of the mole mounds. Then I waited. About 2 days later a small mound popped up in the original spot. Then I had an idea, drive the spike in deeper so the trap is set lower than the hole but high enough for the mole the still slip through. I did that and propped it up with a couple of brick. 1.5 hours later MOLE!!! This is a big relief to have a good trap. I reluctantly tried poison after my initial failures which also failed. So if you have a mole that is not far below the surface drive the spike in deeper than the hole to give the trap some bite in the dirt. Also, knock all your mounds down to make it easier to locate the fresh active mound when the mole is on the move.", "review_title": "A little learning curve to use but I got 'em", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}

For the record I've tried: netting, double netting, moth balls, soap flakes, pepper flakes, ammonia, motion sensor lights, these red lights, and dog poop. The best solutions seemed to be the bird netting, pepper flakes, motion sensor lights, and dog poop. None worked completely though, we had to seal off all the hospitable hiding spaces. I returned these. For what it's worth, the quality seems good.", "review_title": "not effective for raccoons and the blinking is really annoying", "language": "en", "product_category": "lawn_and_garden"}
