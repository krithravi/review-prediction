This size is good for carrying one day's supplies of snacks, camera batteries, travel umbrella, etc. I bought a small travel wallet with a built in hoop that I attached to the \"key holder\" inside the backpack for extra security. The multitude of interior pockets are unnecessary and just added weight if you use a wallet with the backpack. The external water bottle pocket is useless if your are right handed. I used the backpack over my left shoulder so I could slide it around to my right side without taking it off and access the contents with my right hand. This leaves a water bottle \"dangling\" in the water bottle holder. Even when wearing the pack on my back, the water bottle is \"dangling\" and falls out. The first time I used it with my Thermos water bottle, it dropped out and dented the bottle and broke the lid, so it was not available for the rest of the trip. Even plastic disposable water bottles fell out. The bag either needs water bottle holders on both sides so that at least one is usable, or better yet, an elastic anchor strap to securely hold water bottle in place. The external water bottle pouch was the one thing that sold me on this daypack, yet it proved to be almost useless when I used it for real world activities.. A major design flaw so far as I'm concerned. Good security features, but useless water bottle holder.", "review_title": "Water bottle holder is useless", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

It would have been much better if the chest strap had been adjustable up and down. One idea I had was adding a strap all the way across that attaches to the pack instead of the shoulder pads and comes across under his armpits. But that\u2019s a lot of work to make it useable. It\u2019s possible maybe he\u2019ll grow into it a little better eventually but that doesn\u2019t really help me now. It really is cute on him though so if you don\u2019t care about the harness it might be worth getting. One other negative is the adjustable part on the shoulder pads isn\u2019t hemmed, so when you loosen it, it can come all the way out and you have to rethread it.

The money clip is not raised away from the card slot area, so sliding money in under it is very tight and hard to do, especially if you have a few bills or need to quickly grab 1 bill from the clip. Very bad design. (Compared to the Trayvax that has a money clip raised to accommodate easy money access) The size is too big for my liking.

I personally feel this pouch is pretty useless in that regard. Not only it's bulky --- nowhere near \"invisible\" under the clothing as advertised --- the major flaws: 1) The zipper compartments are SIDEWAY, with the locked position at the top of the zipper. This makes no sense to me, because if the zipper lock shifted down (or any pickpocket zip it down), everything in the side compartment would fell off 2) There is no horizontal zipping compartment. An horizontal zipper compartment would makes things less likely falling out. 3) The biggest compartments (back of the pouch) uses velcro. This is 21st Century, hello??? It does not make any retrieval of items any easier. I also happened to have Zero Grid (I am not affiliated) which addresses most of the issues above. The plus with Zero Grid: a) Two horizontal zipping compartments, one of them large enough to hold an iPhone XR (but not anything bigger, that's a minus vs this Venture pouch) b) Zero Grid has the belt bands but this Venture does not .... If you intent to use it around your pant, Zero Grid is the way to go. c) Zero Grid comes with stickers for lost item retrieval (free sign up) ... I stick them onto the back of my family's four passports for peace of mind. It also comes with like $250 lost/stolen guarantee. d) Zero Grid uses double strip --- harder to break (but not sure if it's cut resistant). The Venture is single and also does not appear to be cut resistant. Nevertheless, two is better than one.", "review_title": "Not secure", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

The leather is nice and soft, looks durable and the stitching is nice and straight. The pockets are a bit tight with even 1 card in each, but I assume that will loosen up over time. The width is just a touch larger than I would like (but still reasonable), it fits in a back pocket fine but just a touch smaller would be great. Overall very happy with it.", "review_title": "Great wallet, exactly what I was looking for", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}

I'm 5 ft. 6, around 120 lbs, a size two. I'm pretty much just like the woman in the photo, so I wonder if they pinched the bag in the bag behind her in order to make it fit. The straps are definitely at their smallest, no question there. It's about 4 inches too big for my waist, and if I take one step, the whole bag falls to the floor. So I have to decide whether to return it or keep it as a crossbody bag only. I do like the bag otherwise very much...but I have several crossbody bags and bought this one so I could wear it around the waist during our travels.", "review_title": "I have just one complaint and it's a pretty big one", "language": "en", "product_category": "luggage"}
