It was hard to only give a 3 because it's not bad. The worst part of this stand is the center post and the flip lock that holds it in place. If you put any weight on holding the mike you can expect the center pole to work its way to the floor. There is no protection if you happen to be on a wood floor. There are easy fixes to make this work but I noticed the Amazon basics stand looked identical but had a screw to hold the pole in place. It is very light weight but sturdy at the same time. You would not normally \"lean\" on a mike stand of this type so this is probably not an issue for most. Other than that one flaw I like the way the stand looks. It folds up really small which is really great. A small bag would have been a great touch but with the prices of mike stands already, most are costly. So for the money.

However, I thought I'd have my husband try it before completely giving up. He couldn't budge it at first either, but then he stepped on the base with both feet while pulling up on the silver telescopic pole with one of those rubbery gripper things for opening jars. Finally he was able to pull it up. It moves up and down a bit more easily now, but is still extremely tight. (I know you don't want it too loose so it will stay where you put it, but it's tighter than on other similar music stands I used to use when I played in my high school band.) I think that either the pole should not be made so tight, or else the instructions should warn you that you may have to use extreme measures to get it to extend, so that you won't think it's immovable and defective. There is also an error on the first page of the instructions where the parts are identified -- oddly, they identify the picture of the base as the \"connector\", the picture of the telescopic pole as the \"base\", and the picture of the connector as the \"telescopic pole\". Somebody should have proofread the instructions!

All of the buttons have a plastic click that sounds like they are getting ready to snap . The knobs and faders are completely loose and have too much wobble when you move them and are unsatisfying to use. The actual audio quality of the was horrible. The self noise of the mixer is as loud as the mic. I really tried everything I could to make it sound decent but It didn't work. When I plugged my headset into the monitor there was a loud and obnoxious clicking sound and hiss. I tried it on a clean circuit and it still didn't go away.

No hissing sound, but any chord or combination of keys resulted in a terrible distortion, even with the gain at its lowest.

The instrument arrived already adjusted and ready to play -- I just had to tune the high E string a little. It remains in tune, which is one of the marks of a well crafted instrument. It has a good sound and I was playing tunes the same day.", "review_title": "Very nice beginner violin!", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}

I've tried a couple of over the ear headphones and this one is the most comfortable for medium sized ears. I'm no audiophile but the quality is as good as many of the reviews make it out to be and compared to the microsoft surface headphones, they are noticeably better. The one main issue I have with these headphones is its bluetooth feature. Usually, once my bluetooth speakers or earbuds connect to my pc, I can play from any source at the same time or switch between the sources without the secondary source being muted. These headphones however do that. If i were to play a game such as League of Legends and watch a youtube video while in loading screen and swap back, all my audio for the game is muted. The only way I can get the audio back is by restarting the game. Another example is if I'm editing music on Fl Studio 20 and then play a youtube video, the youtube video is now permanently muted until I close out of Fl Studio. I never had this issue if I'm connected to my pc via the wire provided in the package, but I primarily purchased these over the older m50x because of the bluetooth feature. It's very frustrating to constantly be cautious about what I play because I can potentially mute an application entirely. I attempted to update the firmware but my firmware update always fails to go through. I follow all the steps that the Audio Technica app gives me to the T and I still cannot seem to successfully update the firmware. This is really disappointing that the bluetooth on this headphone sucks because of how amazing the sound quality and comfort is. The sheer amount of inconveniences I go through and the amount of changes I had to make on my everyday workflow in order to work around this bluetooth issue is very annoying. The only reason I have yet to return them is because of how amazing they are, besides the bluetooth. Please fix it or if it has been fixed with the firmware update, fix the app because the app is the only way to update its firmware. I've checked on many online forums on how to update the firmware and the app seems to be the only solution. If this one issue is fixed, I'd say this is the best bang for your buck wireless studio headphones on the market", "review_title": "Solid headphones, Strange Bluetooth", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}

Before I ordered this case, I watched the customer review on Youtube. The new case is fully wrapped and sealed according to the review, but mine wasn\u2019t at all and it looked dirty and a lot of scratches. The worst is that the built-in hygrometer showed foggy and couldn\u2019t see inside the numbers. For sure, the case I received has been used and I guessed it was returned by someone. I feel sooooooooo disappointed and hopeless and feel being cheated. My daughter has been waiting for this case for a while which she really loved this case. She has to use this one for a Christmas performance. I am a Canadian citizen and I paid Canadian fund. If I returned this, I will loose money for return since the exchange rate is different for buy and sell.

I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio.

Basically had to stand right next to the amp for the best sound and was even getting quite frequent drop outs standing next to it, which makes this useless. Also I play metal and my guitars have passive pickups, when I was palm muting I was getting drop outs constantly. I even turned off the wifi router and was acting the same way.

I agree with the other reviews saying that this seat is not made for anyone under 6' tall. I'm 5'9\" and need to sit on the edge of the seat so I could work my foot pedals. The back rest sits too high above the point where it would useful providing any comfort. Having more than just two height setting would address this issue. The seat is wider side to side than it is front to back. The reduced depth gave me the sense I was sitting on 1/2 a chair rather than a full one. Finally, without the ability for the seat to swivel, you really begin asking yourself why you considered this choice in the first place. It would be hard for me to enjoy myself performing music on stage when this piece of equipment is so limiting.

Compared to the Road Runner gig bag I bought earlier, which cost twice as much and doesn't have as much padding, I would feel much more comfortable putting this gig bag in the overhead compartment of an airplane, or any other place it might get jostled about. I only had some very minor disappointments. 1. Size of the outer pocket In the picture, it looked like the outside pocket was larger (see how the top of the pocket in the seller's picture goes up to the middle of the handle, while in actuality, the top of the pocket sits just at the bottom of the handle) I was really hoping a Hal Leonard method book would fit in the pocket, but I knew that was a long shot, even if the pocket was the size in the seller's picture. I took a picture of the bag next to a method book for scale. This bag won't even hold the much smaller Hal Leonard Ukulele Chord Finder book, which my Road Runner gig bag can hold. (I also took a picture of the chord finder book peeking out of the pocket.) Still, it holds my accessories just fine. 2. Perhaps too much padding around the headstock? I'm a little worried about accidentally turning the tuning keys when I take my ukulele in and out of this bag. A minor annoyance, but might be worth it for the extra protection. 3. The zipper doesn't seem as durable as the one on my Road Runner bag, but it doesn't seem like a cheap zipper either.

I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.", "review_title": "Cool concept!

Serious drummers will replace the heads right away, and be sure to lube the lug threads as you assemble the kit.

Better than anything I've ever heard. Supposedly, they are the best closed back headphones you can get at this price range. And I am inclined to believe that. They come with a leather (possibly real) carrying bag, a comically long straight cord, and an annoyingly sized spiral cord. The spiral cord went down to my knees with my music player in my pocket, making it not ideal for commuting. I purchased a much shorter cord for my commute for around $10. Very impressed overall. However, these broke on me after 3 and a half months of use. I took them off and SNAP, a piece of the hinge on my left side snapped, leaving wires exposed and the headphones unwearable (they still work). Throughout my ownership of these cans, whenever I moved the ear cups, there was a cracking sound, like the plastic was screaming for help. I thought that this was just an odd feature, but I now believe it to be a design or manufacturing flaw. I am unsure if Audio Technica and/or Amazon would cover this under a warranty or not. I do not have the budget to pay them to fix it, buy new headphones, or waste money shipping the headphones back and forth to possibly get a free repair done. So, I will probably have to do a crappy epoxy or tape job to fix these, as I absolutely cannot stand to listen to dollar store ear buds anymore. I bought these headphones not only because of the sound, but because I was led to believe that these were extremely durable headphones that would last me years to come. That is perfect, because I used these on my daily commute, brought them camping, took them halfway across the US with me, and I used them for practicing my instruments. But alas, they did not last, so I cannot recommend these headphones with their current build quality, unless you are to only use them at your desk. And at that point, you might as well buy more expensive, better sounding headphones (not that these sound bad, because they don't). I am impressed, but at the same time thoroughly disappointed in this product. I cannot recommend these to your average consumer.

We didn't know it until we were messing around with them for a bit, but they are sound sensitive, the color's will change with sound or dance with the bass of music. Very neat little lights. And best if all they are rechargeable!!", "review_title": "very neat, rechargable light!", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}

It went on my guitar easily. The intonation is great with the compensated saddles, which *are* brass. The chrome is only polished on part of the bridge, which is consistent with vintage Fender bridges and is pointed out by the seller if you read the description. This bridge may seem a little rough around the edges to you, but that's because they've been making them the same way for over 60 years. This is the way this bridge is supposed to be.", "review_title": "Fit perfectly on my MIM Telecaster", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}

It's huge and cumbersome. And you have a tiny usb to laptop connection that does nothing for sound quality.

This snare stand proved to be a disappointment, however. Unlike other Gibraltar products where the fasteners are all metal, the wing nut that adjusts the basket arms is made of plastic, and mine arrived broken in pieces. I was going to return it for a replacement, but then I had second thoughts, and ended up getting a Pearl snare stand which is awesome. This one instance won't keep me from continuing to buy Gibraltar stuff, though. :)", "review_title": "Design concern made me return it", "language": "en", "product_category": "musical_instruments"}
