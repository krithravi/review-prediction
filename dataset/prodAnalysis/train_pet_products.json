We ultimately purchased this style cone and it worked very well with just one flaw. The cover on this style is excellent as it prevents the dog from puncturing the blow up donut inside. There is a velcro type strap that crosses the opening and secures the donut securely. It makes it adjustable to fit a range of size in dogs necks. The problem was that the black strap was not strong enough. The pup probably did chew on it a bit when the donut rotated so the strap was under his chin. I did have to sew and reinforce the strap three different times. So, I wish that it had a stronger strap, but overall the design was excellent and kept the pup from reaching areas he wasn't supposed to scratch.

The unit itself is a nice size not too bulky my dog is 35 lbs and rather small she doesnt even seem to notice the box. Display is easy to read and all the functions are on one button and easy to change sensitivity and mode settings. I love that it has the option for no shock and a shock option. The product will beep for a few seconds vibrate twice then give a small static shock when in shock mode. Very light shock ive had worse in the winter from a blanket but enough to discourage the dog from barking. In no shock mode the unit will beep and vibrate only. I plan to use shock mode at first then transition into the no shock. I like that it allows you to do this by keeping the beeps and vibrations before the shock once trained the beep will be enough to stop the behavior without needing the added correction of the shock. The collars provided are easy to slip into the main unit while not recommended for tie out or walking are nicely made the nylon one has a well fastening plastic buckle and the plastic one has a belt clip and holes. Both are reflective as well so that is an added bonus.

So we had to go back to the old cat litter box for her, she seems much happier now, and she always goes in the litter box instead of on the floor of her pen.

That being said, this implementation just seems a bit... lacking. It's the absolute opposite of intuitive, and even though I consider myself quite tech-savvy, I still have to look at the manual to figure out how to do the most basic things. Most actions require holding down two small buttons at one time and pressing repeatedly, over and over, to get the value where you want. It's as if the creators did absolutely zero user testing or didn't focus at all on the actual experience of using this device, since most interactions are far more complex than they need to be. One other fairly major issue I have with the device is that if it's unplugged, all my settings seem to reset (which, as you can guess from what I said before, is quite annoying since resetting everything to the correct settings takes forever and is an absolute pain). This happens regularly since my cats move around the area and occasionally unplug the device, or if I lose power I have to redo everything. In the short period of time I've had the device, I've had to completely redo all the settings 3 times. Other than all that, the device works as expected and dispenses food if your settings are correct, which is why I'm still giving it the stars that I am: My cats do eat from it and it's made my life a lot easier.

The problem I have with it is... you can see the screws in a couple areas. Like the top, flat part of the screw. We installed the cubbies in different angles ( not all the openings going the same way ) because we thought she would enjoy that and she does. She never uses the scratching posts lol. The little toy that is attached to the top bed, she absolutely loves. My only other issue with this condo is the top part (the bed) It\u2019s just a soft cover over a piece of wood.

The issue with these bowls is the difficulty in getting a set that isn't damaged. I have now received two sets of bowls. As you can see in one of my pictures, you will be lucky to get a set of bowls that are not damaged since both sets I received were packed in a large box with a single layer of thin bubble wrap around each bowl and very little else. All that empty space you see in the box was room for the bowls to move around, hit each other and chip. The first set I received had a defect in the glaze that was very sharp and could have easily cut our dogs tongue when licking the bowl. Since the bowls are bought as a set, you have to return the full set in order to get a refund. Our second set arrived packed the same way (so it wasn't a one time packing mistake). The second set had a very large chip as is seen in the second picture. So, I guess the only way to get two bowls that are not damaged is to again request a replacement set, wait to send back the set you are replacing, hope the new set arrives with at least one undamaged bowl, keep the one bowl from each set that isn't chipped and send back as a set the two bowls that arrived with chips OR Amazon could invest in providing training for their packers.", "review_title": "Beautiful bowls, but difficult to get them without damage.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

I found it hard to believe that anyone would store and ship an aquatic plant without any water. It does arrive near-dead. Most sellers ship the aquatic plants inside of a small basket with a paper-towel type substance that keeps the roots wet during transit. This listing is shipped in nothing more than a standard cellophane bag. It is indeed a large quantity but after you trim the dead spots and put it in your tank more dies off. My beautiful tank is of dead plant particles. I do believe that over time I may be able to save some of the plant and hope the new growth compensates for the 3/4 of dead plant. Absolutely would not buy again nor recommend. I would return the damn thing but I know amazon would just throw it out and I hate to kill a plant that has already been tortured. Fingers crossed that I can revive this little guy. UPDATE: I changed my review from 1 star to 3. After 2 long weeks dealing with the plant deteriorating new growth began as little tiny petals on the stems. I have almost gotten all of the dead plant out of the tank and we are at the 3-week mark. It is now growing really fast and looking great. I am surprised that it has spanned itself about 24\" across the tank. It's a stringy-type plant so it isnt \"thick\" but it makes the tank look genuinely \"natural freshwater\" if that's the look you're going for. It grows really long roots that basically float in the water. It's actually pretty cool.

She was completely content to let me tug at her neck, even hold her off the ground by the collar. Which is not a great idea for her health. I consider myself pretty good at dog training, but I have been a complete failure at leash training. I read recently that the reason my other harnesses make pulling worse is that is just gives the dog more efficiency at pulling, and I needed to invest in a front clip harness. I picked one with high reviews, not really knowing the difference. Here\u2019s my review on this one: Pros: -lovely color -elastic stretching at key points seemed to lesson the effort it took to pull her back -it worked. She stopped pulling in the first 7 minutes -able to fit a barrel chested but slim dog -once I strung the leash through the handle on the back, it stopped twisting on her front. Cons: -the elastic stretching does allow it to ride forward sometimes, but during our walk it didn\u2019t seem to bother her. -my dog acted like I beat her (like she does when being put into all harnesses) until I got the leash out. -it took some time to find the right fit, for her, the key was letting out around the neck, so the back part could be cinched tighter where she is thinner. This also meant that it twisted a little as she pulled, until I realized I could feed the leash through the back handle and it wouldn\u2019t pull the harness as crooked. This is definitely how I\u2019ll harness her from now on. -the security locks (red buttons) on the plastic clips are something I can\u2019t find the purpose of. They make it so you can unclasp the harness, but they don\u2019t serve a useful function for me.", "review_title": "Worked like magic, with a few tweaks.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

One of our kittens uses the scratch posts regularly, but the other still wants to use our rug. They enjoy the hideaway house the most and nap there daily.

I got online to read more about other products in the Wondercide line & read that it repels ants as well so I tried it on a trail of ants & it worked!

I eventually got it off, got the piece that broke off, put it back together and the ribbon part fell off. Took four tries to get that to stay on. I'm getting dirty looks by this time.

My new dog ate the cover, so I ordered this one, which is slightly smaller. The size and shape are great. Once again, no opposite-side handhold. The casters are smaller, which makes it less able to go over the edge of the rug, but easier to fit under the shelf. The cover doesn't fold all the way back as the bigger tote's did, which is a real pain when picking it up and inverting it to empty. The cover can't be folded out of the way, instead flopping into the food as it's pouring out. The worst of it, though, is that the top is really flimsy - it crushes down if anything is set on top of it. The gasket is good and the latch holds well, but I have to put a weight on top to keep the dog from opening it. With the old one, a six-pack of soda worked great.

It worked pretty well for those 2 months. We loved the features it has and appreciated the price. However, from day one, the static correction button (was poorly made) would get stuck if pushed, so we couldn't use it. About a week ago, I turned on the remote and it started beeping and the screen kept flashing. Now it won't stay on for more than 2 seconds. Would I purchase another? The answer is no. My next training collar will be less budget friendly, and hopefully much better quality. ORIGINAL REVIEW: We purchased this product to assist us training our 7 month old great dane. It is really great so far, especially for the price! It has several great features. We love that there is a lock/unlock switch on the remote to prevent accidental corrections. It is also nice that we can turn the remote off when it is not being used. We like that the static level is adjustable, and that we also have the beep and vibrate options. The collar fits our dog nicely right now, but she still has a lot of growing to do. It remains to be seen if she will outgrow this collar. The fact that you can train up to 9 dogs using the one remote is nice, although we only need it for one dog at the moment. Additionally, the remote and the receiver charge pretty quickly. Now the cons. The receiver is quite big and bulky. It would look completely ridiculous on a small dog. The receiver prongs are not centered (they are on the bottom), so the collar sits kind of awkwardly on the dog's neck. The receiver has no on/off button should you wish to turn it off. The set comes with only one charge cord, so you have to charge the remote and/or receiver one at a time. Also, this training collar did not come with anything to test the static like some other training collars do. If you want to test it out, you have to zap yourself to know if it is working. Overall, great for the price and has several nice features.", "review_title": "The price was right at the time.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

If your dog needs to reach something any higher than 2' off the ground, you may need to look for something else. But the low height is a positive for us because the ramp is not so steep and less intimidating. We also like the surface which is kind of like a soft plastic pot scrubber. Provides a nice, slip-free grip. It is also fairly light & portable but a designed-in set of handles would be a nice addition. Should have mentioned, the thing that worked the best for getting her to use the ramp was that we put a harness on her and gently led her up the ramp with firm, slow pulling. She really had no option but to go right up the ramp. After a few times with this, the coaxing with treats finished the job.

However, I have not got to use it for it's intended purpose. My dog hates it. She refuses lay in it and because the material is just like a jersey type material with nothing in the bottom to keep it sturdy and safe, I'm not comfortable trying to force her into using it. It does come with a latch to hook the dog in place, but it does seem long enough and they way my dog acted in it, I would be worried she would choke herself. Maybe if she was a smaller dog or used to be in a carrier it would have been different. It did hold up surprisingly well in the chaos that ensued with her trying to get out of the carrier and it did not turn her out of it, so maybe for someone else, this is a good purchase, I'm just not going to make my dog unnecessarily uncomfortable.", "review_title": "Nice dog sling, dog hated it.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

I got it to them just in time for their New Year's Eve party. There they were, drinking the night away with their cat like the true class-act couple they are. Needless to say, I didn't realize their cat was a minor. Being as the cat was under the age of 21, the police were called. The cat had to take a breathalyzer. Catnip levels were off the chart. My brother took the fall, saying it was all his idea and is now serving 10 to life for giving catnip to a minor feline. We've tried appeals but all our lawyers have abandoned us. The cat is now 1 month sober and advocating for cat age awareness. My brother's girlfriend tried to contact the cat once but got huge amounts of backlash in the media. What a scandal. Was it worth it? Was all this (plus like $13.00 for the cat wine) worth destroying a young couple and tearing apart a new feline family? Yes. 10/10 would buy for the next cat.", "review_title": "A night to remember", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

I have a 1.5 year old female boxer mix, about 65lbs. I don't think there's a harness or training technique we haven't tried to get her to behave on a walk. This was no different. She yanked the same as ever and got the harness twisted around her so that the top and bottom became the sides. While this seems to be made well, it's still entirely useless.", "review_title": "Tore in 3 weeks, never helped with pulling, sized terribly", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

I purposely purchased the 2 door for both so I can have options to position in either room although when using the puppy divider it clips on the side door so this door is not functional until the divider is not longer needed. Also, the divider clips well to one side but is loose on the other side and it is not a tight fit for safety. I did call Midwest support and they were very nice. They did confirm that with a 2 door the divider does not work. They requested pictures of the clasping issue with the divider on one side. Not sure there is anything to be done and my little girl is coming home in 2 days so I will just deal with it. It is a sturdy crate and has little rubber rollers on the bottom to help moving but take care moving over hardwood floors as it did touch it somehow without lifting and just rolling. Had to give 3 stars since the divider does not work with the 2 door option. This was very important for my needs.", "review_title": "Puppy Divider with 2-door Crate is not Functional", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

They use pillars on the 4 corners that you secure with bolts to create the box shape. Also the top perches have no side structure either so the cat really has nothing to lean against.

When they did, the end panel split off from the other panel (broke off). The pictures you see posted of the broken gates is exactly where mine broke, except mine broke completely off. We are making it work because 2 panels fits perfectly ok front of my stair entry. We still have the feet on the two panels. So it breaks easily, but I'm not too upset. I'll use this until I find a wrought iron gate! ************* Works in front of my stairs! I got the smaller height hoping it wouldn't be too short. It's perfect in front of the bottom step of our stairs. The dogs don't even try to jump it, but they are generally good with respecting a gate or barrier of any sort. It is still tall enough for them to not see it as an easy jump. They are Pitt Bull/Lab and Pitt Bull/Boxer mixes so they are considered medium height. If you plan to put it in front of something and are trying to just step over the gate, probably go with the shorter height gate like I did. We don't typically move the gate unless we are carrying something up the stairs. We just step over onto the next step up. I have wood laminate floors, and I'm really glad I bought the feet that are recommended or listed as \"people who buy this also buy...\" I think they are worth it. If you plan to keep it completely straight against something, get the feet. The gate's stability, when stretched out completely straight, is compromised. I didnt need the linger version either.

When this collar arrived it fit him perfect and the bright red looked precious on his shiny black fur. I was able to take him for a walk with no problem with the leash was connected to both metal rings. The boys play ALL THE TIME and the collar does disconnect as designed. The only downside is that once it disconnects it becomes a toy for the dogs to play with. The collar lasted 3 days before they chewed it in half.

Pros: extremely quiet, reliable biological filtration, water flow adjustment, leveling mechanism included. Cons: more expensive than the competition (worth every penny). Buy it. The long story is that I purchased a Marineland Penguin 200 at the big box pet store with my tank. I had trouble with it from the beginning, after much frustration and a lot of wasted money, I threw it out and replaced it with this Fluval C Power Filter. I completely regret not starting with the Fluval filter, because it is worth every extra dollar spent over the competition. This machine is as easy to assemble as any clip-on power filter, has a reliable biological filtration system, and is so quiet - I am still in disbelief. I can hardly hear it running. The water flow is also adjustable, which I find that my fish appreciate. There was one bizarre thing though. My filter arrived with all the parts, in a box, wrapped in plastic (so seemingly new), yet the filter components seemed like they had been used and then cleaned. I say this because there were seveal spots on the interior components of the filter that were smudged and dirty. I wiped my finger over it and the substance smeared off.

When I ran out of my last jug, I came here to Amazon to buy another and saw there were some negative reviews about the smell. Since I always found the smell very pleasant, I wasn't sure why people were leaving these reviews; I thought maybe they just didn't like it. Then, I saw there was an \"old formula\" being sold. Figuring they made a change, I decided to play it safe and get the \"old\" one. I didn't receive the old formula. (The seller was \"Washington Blvd Sales\".) Instead, I received what I'm positive must be the new formula -- which is awful. It has a headache-inducing perfume, reminiscent of what I remember lice shampoo smelling like. Not only does it not deter my cats peeing in the same spot, it doesn't seem to get rid of the urine smell anymore. I made the mistake of not trying it on a surface before using it. In my defense, I bought the \"old formula\" and assumed it was the same product I've been purchasing for years. Well, I sprayed my couch with it and now it smells like pee and this dreadful perfume.

The packaging during shipment leaves a LOT to be desired. Although shipped inside an Amazon box, since there was no padding a piece of plastic meant to hold one of the clips for the top of the filter was busted through the filter box and broken off. 2. The item I received was clearly a returned item and was missing pieces. If it wasn't a time-sensitive need to get this setup I would have returned it for a replacement. Aside from those initial snags... The setup of this filter is really straight-forward. The included media is wholly contained, so there's no extra time needed to unpackage each media item, rinse and install like other canister filters. Just rinse and set into the can. The attachment of the lid is really simple. Even with the broken plastic piece when the item arrived, the way the clips are designed means I am still able to secure the lid confidently. I was initially concerned by the amount of hose included since other reviews had complained about that as well, but it proved to be more than enough and I even have left-over. That being said, my setup is a little unique as the tank is only 9\" tall, and the canister filter is stored just two feet below that. I also have an inline heater which adds significant length to the return. What I really like about this filter is how easy it is to customize it. My tank is 36\" x 9\" x 8\", so the spray bar that comes with is way too long to mount on the side of the tank. Since the pipe isn't brittle, it's really easy to shorten using a Dremel. I also drilled additional holes in the spray bar to make sure shortening the bar didn't unnecessarily increase the force of the spray. Secondarily, the intake pipe is too long too for the height of my tank, so I shortened that as needed with the Dremel. Coming from being spoiled by self-priming canister filters I did have a brief WTF moment when turning this on. But it's a super-simple process to create a vacuum through the intake tube by sucking on the end until it fills with water, close the end, reattach to the filter, then open back up and turn the filter on. Good to go. As far as noise... I *think* it's whisper quiet... I can't hear it over the noise of my Whisper brand air pumps. lol So far I'm pretty satisfied. The shipping issue definitely needs to be addressed, and quality control on screening return items before reshipping them will go a long way to prevent more people from unnecessarily re-returning those items or leaving bad reviews.", "review_title": "A few problems, but otherwise good.", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

In past years, we have had friends or hired pet sitters to come by daily (sometimes twice daily) to feed our cats. This year, I thought there's got to be some value provided by an automatic pet feeder, so we took the plunge and bought this PetSafe unit. I had read the reviews where people complained about one push of the button not completely priming the feed conveyor and other complications people had encountered getting the device on wifi, etc. My experience with this product is that it is entirely intuitive for a reasonable consumer. If you've ever put a device like an Amazon Echo or a wireless laser printer on your home wifi network, the setup for this feeder is no different. The app is very intuitive and there is an option front-and-center for priming the feed conveyor with a single click within the app. We have been using the feeder for more than a month set with a daily schedule of two feedings. One at 6:00 AM and one at 5:30 PM. This works great for our two cats. The kibble does make noise when it falls into the bowl, and that's why I selected these times-- it decreases the likelihood the cats will be nearby when the feeding occurs. We have had zero jams in our usage and I'll update this review if we encounter any in the coming years. For future trips, we will have a webcam pointed at the feeding station so we can monitor the bowl remotely and send a friend over to attend to any jams should they occur while we're away. Finally, my only concern with this device is that it is dependent on the vendor's cloud infrastructure. If the company goes out of business, this device will cease to work", "review_title": "awesome product, already paid for itself!", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

Now that's good business! Thank you! It's loud, it's a pain to clean, the filter does absolutely nothing to keep the water clean. Also, unless your cat likes to drink where the water spouts out, they won't use it because the dish is not large enough for a cat's head to comfortably fit without bumping into the piece that covers the pump. I personally don't mind the sound, I like the sound of water trickling, but it's very noticeable compared to other fountains we've had. Sadly instead of replacing my other fountain we now use both because one cat will drink out of the spout but the other will not so he uses our fountain that has a nice large pool to drink from. So now I'm doing twice the cleaning and assembling. The pump is great, very strong flow of water, but because of that many cats may avoid it. Also the heavy flow causes rapid evaporation.

I had considered buying the titanium set which said were non allergenic and was good to use on dogs with sensitive skin. I decided to go with this because it also stated it was for dogs with sensitive skin. It is definitely not made of titanium which I could tell from the picture and also does not claim to be. This product made my dogs neck redder than the original stainless one. Was a little disappointed that it claimed to be used for dogs with sensitive skin and did not help. I went ahead and bought the titanium set and redness has decreased drastically but not gone completely away. Love the idea of the four prongs but would like to see them made in titanium compared to brass or copper or whatever these are. I'm sure the four prongs is more comfortable but if it irritates the skin that bad then it would kinda defeat the purpose. Please make them with titanium tips.

The small is a little bit bigger than a golf ball, so if you have a bigger dog get the bigger size. The sounds are annoying at first but then it just becomes background noise. There is no off button but the sounds are motion triggered so they don't go off when it's put away. The only downside is the battery doesn't last long. It's been about 3 weeks and the sounds are fading. Will need to change soon. My dog loved this so much I also purchased the one that lights up.", "review_title": "My dog is obsessed!

It took less than a day for Abe and Emmy to catch on once the collars were on them. Ah, \"the sounds of silence\"! It's a quality, sturdy product and being able to recharge it rather than buying batteries was a big plus for me. Two observations I'd like to share: (1) one reviewer remarked that the unit was too big for her small dog. Emmy is petite and 22 pounds, and the unit is a bit overwhelming on her neck, too. (2) The unit went off once when Abe shook his head, and once when another dog standing near him barked.

This is unfortunate as the muzzle is super soft, comfortable for a dog to wear, and adjustable (just not adjustable small enough for our smaller dog). Other reviewers state the dog can tear this off. Our purpose was to walk the dog and have him be able to breathe, bark, pant, etc., just not pick up objects from the ground. This would have been PERFECT!! I would not leave a dog to not try to remove this is for a wound or for biting or other aggressive behavior. However, to avoid licking while being observed or to avoid eating things without restricting other normal dog behavior, this is a really great design and product. Had this fit, the dog also did not balk at it being on him as we attempted to make the sizing work.

So that meant that it isnt as secure as i wanted it to be. the belt that attaches the dog to the seat doesnt even really attach to the seat but to the seatbelt (which again is easy to come off as the sides have an opening) so whats the point really, just serves as a cozy dog bed and not really a car seat in my opinion.", "review_title": "Not the best quality", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

I've been a long-time PetNet customer, having had a Gen 1 PetNet feeder for our middle-aged cat over the past three years. In general, the Gen 1 feeder has worked sufficiently enough that we've managed to keep our cat well fed over that time. Fast forward to this week, when my wife adopted a second cat. So, naturally, we purchased a second PetNet feeder to that we could feed the kitten separately. Much to my surprise, when setting up the new feeder, we discovered that PetNet allows only ONE feeder per household account. You CANNOT have use two PetNet feeders under the same account. You must register another account -- completely different email address -- and setup the second PetNet under that account. Unreal. That means that, barring having every person in your house register a separate PetNet account for each dog and cat in a multi-pet home, you cannot centrally manage more than one feeder. The physical quality of the Gen 2 feeder is decent enough, and the setup was fairly easy once I got past discovering that I couldn't register two feeders under a single account. The PetNet app is SEVERELY lacking in flexibility and function, as I've previously mentioned. We've decided to keep this feeder simply because we're in a bind and need the automated feeding for the kitten during the workday. If we werent in a bind, we'd return the feeder tomorrow and find another brand that actually supports multiple pets in a single household. I'm rating this feeder at two stars -- which represents the number of accounts that I had to setup with PetNet in order to support my two PetNet feeders. Seriously, I suggest looking elsewhere. It appears that there are much better alternatives out there. Caveat emptor.", "review_title": "You have got to be kidding me!

Update***** I\u2019m taking away one star because they kept getting caught when I would use it on my older schnauzers. They work pretty fine with the pups but the more hair and it looks uneven. I\u2019d suggest just only purchasing for small pups or to shave the hair in the paws.", "review_title": "Gentle and easy to use!", "language": "en", "product_category": "pet_products"}

My intent was to replace an Aquaclear 50 that was too noisy but this filter was significantly louder then my Aquaclear. Considering some people swear this is the quietest HOB filter available and others have had similar experiences to me I wonder about the consistency of the construction. As for some positive things to say the filter does feel sturdy, you are not forced to keep buying filter media, the flow is adjustable, and it has a protein skimmer.
