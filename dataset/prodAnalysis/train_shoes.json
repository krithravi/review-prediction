I look at computer screens/tablets all day between work and school. I study everything on my tablet and I\u2019ve wearing them for 45 minutes and until removing them off to see if they make a difference, and wow they really do. It makes the colors on the screen appear slightly warmer which is just the right amount for the eyes. You can literally feel your eyes trying to adjust to the blue light once you remove the glasses.

I try not to overstuff it as I did with one that was pretty much an exact replica but with metal zippers. THAT one lasted about a year before the zippers started failing in different ways. This one has nylon zippers and they do work fine. The material doesn't feel like genuine leather to me, but more like a man-made material that tries to replicate leather, and does it fairly well. It's close enough that I can't swear that it's not real leather, however, for the price that I paid, I didn't expect it to be genuine leather (again, it might be genuine, I really can't tell for sure). Basically at this point, if it lasts a few more months without defect, I will feel that I have gotten my money's worth, and after that, if it should fail in some way, I will probably buy another one just like it, perhaps a different color just to change things up a bit.

They are adorable - true to photo. The high-top design of the opening not only keeps my ankles warm, it also keeps the slippers from coming off easily -- and from shopping around, this seems like a pretty unique feature. The slippers are very well-padded and feel very snug on the foot (although most of the padding is actually on top of the foot; there's not much padding on the sole, so if you're walking in these a lot, it will probably flatten.) All of these aspects make me really want to love these slippers. BUT I'm so let down by the fabrication. They seem to have focused entirely on the exterior of the slipper and ignored the interior. I want these to keep my feet cozy. But the interior fabric is not very soft, and doesn't feel good on my feet. Even worse, there is an exposed seam running around the interior of the slipper -- i.e. the fabric is sewn together, and the two ends are not tucked behind the seam, but extrude into the interior of the slipper and poke into my feet. Basically, every time I wear these I want to put on socks, to make my feet more comfortable -- but if I'm already going to put socks on, I don't really need the slippers, so...

I guess that would be fine if it held up. But it did not hold up. Ive been wearing them almost daily for shower shoes and the toe piece on the right sandal has slipped halfway out rendering the sandals unwearable after only a few months use for a few minutes a day. No outdoor hiking, no running or tennis. no catching the front of the sole on anything. just walking down the hall to the shower and back. Maybe it is the heavy duty stiff sole. Maybe the right sandal didn't get enough glue and it's a fluke. I don't know. What I do know is that for the price I paid I would have expected to get several years of heavy use out of them but they barely lasted 6 months of the lightest possible use.

I explained that, although the glasses are too small for my son, he liked them and didn\u2019t want to return them. He likely will not wear them, but it\u2019s his gift to return, or not return. The Mr Happy Store offered me a 30% refund, which I felt was generous, considering we didn\u2019t return them. They also pointed out the sizing of their glasses on the website. I very much appreciated their customer service and willingness to work with their customers. Their product is well made and stylish. As I said in my first review, they are small on my kid, but I would check the dimensions and take a chance if you like the look. This seller is very responsive, so you can\u2019t lose anything! Bought these for my son. Firstly, I read reviews before my purchase, regarding size and quality. My son is built like a football player, he\u2019s tall and has an extra large head/face. Someone mentioned they fit a large face, so I took a chance. They are much too small for his face. The quality is good and the lenses are, indeed, as dark as they say. If you\u2019re sporting a head that fits a large frame, these might not be for you.

I got a new one, it has been used before. You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty. I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself, about 60 $. So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter.

Some things like shoes I'd never buy online without seeing or trying on elsewhere. No surprise on the fit or color or anything else. Basically I ordered through Amazon because they were $9 cheaper than the sale price at the shoe store and qualified for free shipping. No brainer. They look good, fit well and are comfortable for me anyway. Edited two weeks later: I still like these shoes from the standpoint of fit and comfort. However I have an issue with the color that was not apparent till I wore them in bright sunlight. They are the dark brown color which is fine in shade, artificial light, and at night. However, it bright sunlight, they have a definite dark olive green tint to them which I don't really care for. I hope that it eventually fades.

Although it absolutely has no padding, it would still fit if it was in a sleeve.

I have been wearing the typical plain black \"work shoes\" since 2001. I've burned through many pairs of work shoes from different brands and for the most part, not a single pair has held up for more than a year or so. This shoe was no exception. I will say that top of the shoe (the part that other people see) is holding up fine after 15 months now. With other shoes I have owned, the top part gets tore up, creased and ugly after a year. I don't abuse my shoes, but I wear them daily and I walk and crouch often. However, it is the other parts of the shoe that concerns me. The memory foam felt awesome for a few months, but around the year mark (or sooner), that memory foam no longer remembered anything. It became flat and nonexistent. Sad considering I sit more than I stand or walk at work, so it's not like I was standing all the time and smashing it down. Also, the tread on my shoes is completely wore off, so any surface that is remotely slippery is unsafe for me to walk in in these shoes. No matter what brand of shoe I buy, whether they're $60 or $20, none of them are that great after a year.", "review_title": "An Honest Opinion", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}

Tons of pockets keep me organized and it has amazing space capacity which is awesome since I have 3 kids. The only con is that if you use the stroller straps it's hard to zip the bag closed since it's hanging oddly from the straps. But you can't have it all right?

I had just about given up on finding a new band for my tracker that wasn\u2019t made of ugly cheap plastic like the band it comes with when purchased. The whole point of buying the Alta model of a Fitbit was the fact that it was waterproof and supposedly held a charge for 7-10 days, which means after a full charge I should be able to wear the tracker for 7-10 days, without removing it during that time frame. I knew the band the Alta came with was functional but ugly, but I had done some research and discovered that there were all sorts of replacement bands available to purchase, unlike the Fitbit HR I currently owned, which comes with an attached band that isn\u2019t removeable. So I bought the Alta model, and started looking for a nice band for it. I really wanted something in sterling silver, but was never able to find a band made in silver, so instead I spent $100 on a stainless steel bangle made by a designer who will go unnamed, it lasted about 6 months, then the plastic insert that connected the bangle to the tracker broke and fell out, leaving me with a useless bangle that couldn\u2019t be repaired or refunded or exchanged. After that, I bought several other bands advertised to be stainless steel but weren\u2019t, and a few leather bands that were so cheaply made they broke after a few wears. I bet at this point I have wasted more money on bands than I spent on the actual tracker to start with. Another issue was the bands all came with shiny chrome-like metal clips where they attached to the tracker, and the Alta is made of a burnished silver, so the clips and the tracker didn\u2019t match and it looked stupid. maybe I\u2019m the only one who has had this problem, but I find that hard to believe. This last time I ordered 4 bands from four different companies, a black band, metal, similar to a watch band, with a metal clasp, a brown leather band with a buckle clasp, a double wrap band made with metal links advertised as stainless steel and embellished with semi-precious stones, and this band. This band and the black band are the only two I\u2019m keeping, and I may have to return the black one as well, despite having come with a tool and directions for use, I haven\u2019t been able to remove any links to adjust it and in its current size it\u2019s unwearable. This band is pretty and doesn\u2019t look like a strictly sport/athletic band, like the plastic bands do, so I can wear it with other jewelry without it sticking out like a big black rubber thumb, it\u2019s elastic/stretchy, so it doesn\u2019t require adjustment in order to use it, the clips which attach the band to the tracker are the same burnished steel as the tracker and match it, providing a seamless fit when the tracker and the band are connected, and finally the band is reasonably priced. Whether or not it\u2019s durable remains to be seen, but if it isn\u2019t then I\u2019m only out $10 versus $100.", "review_title": "A PRETTY BAND THAT FITS FINALLY", "language": "en", "product_category": "shoes"}
