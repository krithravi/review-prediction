I liked it at first but comparing it to the ones I purchased from Liberty Imports these cars look SO MUCH CHEAPER and feels so flimsy and weak. Initially what I liked about these were the friction wheels seemed more intact and aligned compared the my other purchase, until the day it happened and the friction started messing up and would not roll as good as before. I've tried reaching to the seller but they were giving me such a hard time that I honestly dont want to deal with them anymore and just having to return them back to amazon. Overall with the cheap look, cheap plastic material and design, cheap wheels, and horrible customer service I would give it negative star if I could. Stray away from this and go somewhere else like Liberty Imports. Looks so much better, feels sturdier, and more worth your money.", "review_title": "MADE WITH CHEAP MATERIALS!!

I set out the play dirt in a tray to start. It didn't smell bad, and the dirt was actually soft and not coarse, similar to kinetic sand. It doesn't stick to clothing or surfaces. I realized later that the directions recommended letting it sit out for a few hours prior to play in order for it to loosen up, but that didn't seem necessary in our case.

It won't record video and you won't have extremely precise control over it, but it is fun to play around with. Keep in mind that it is for indoor use, if there's any wind at all it will probably get knocked out of the sky. For indoor use it works very well though, it's really small and light so there's not much damage it could cause. The battery also only lasts for 5 minutes even though it takes a couple hours to charge, but that's fairly common with such small drones at this price point. The only annoying things about this drone are - 1) The packaging; everything is zip-tied in AND taped down, making it extremely difficult to open and unpack. This was common with toys many years ago, but I thought companies had realized this was very unnecessary. 2) The controller requires a screwdriver and four AAA batteries, which at least for me, were not included. The drone itself is rechargeable which is nice, but it would be great if the controller was as well. They could at least not require a screwdriver to take off the back panel, so the batteries were easier to change. 3) The drone got stuck on the ceiling a few times, even after resetting it, changing the batteries, etc. It didn't occur too often, but enough to make the 'annoying' list. By stuck I mean that it stopped receiving any communication from the controller, went all the way to the ceiling, and stayed there until it was either physically removed or the battery died. Despite the little annoying things it's a fun little toy, great for kids because it can't cause much damage and it's pretty easy to fly.", "review_title": "Decent fun", "language": "en", "product_category": "toy"}

Fakespot.com gives it a ranking of D, which means it is very likely that there are a lot of fake good reviews here. Pro: The robot is a new category of toy, or you can even call it a pet. It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so. It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise. It greets you when you get home (you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though). In summary, being autonomous is a major pro that you can't see from other products. Cons: 1: too slow in processing your command. I think the chip is from 2015. So can't expect too much in terms of processing speed. Also you can't expect it to be that smart because of this. 2. Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge. The worst part is that sometimes when it's right on the edge, it misunderstands to be on air. This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off. I don't think this is merely a problem of software. 3. It gets boring. Soon you'll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable. You get bored of it after no longer than a week. A toy is just a toy at the end. You don't want to spend $250 and eventually forget about it. In summery. It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this. But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly. If you have extra money and really want the new experience, just get it. If you're debating whether to get it or not, don't trust the positive reviews here and forget about it -- it does not worth $250 (or even $150) yet.", "review_title": "My thoughts after 2 weeks of use", "language": "en", "product_category": "toy"}

If any mixture gets into the wire section, take a hair dryer on high back and forth in front of where the bubbles come out to dry the wires out and it will start working correctly again. Took me about 5 minutes with both of these with the hair dryer. Stop every so often and test it to see if it's working yet. Just be sure to take it back and forth and all over so it doesnt get to hot, I've done that with both of these so far and they started working again.

So if anyone has kids that throw a fit when they stop working try doing this to get them working. Now into the review lol!! These bubble guns are okay, my reasoning for being just \"okay\" is because any little bit of bubble mixture gets up by the wires they stop working \ud83d\ude44 which is very annoying! If they would redo the wiring and make it where the mixture cannot get to them it would be an amazing product but until then I wouldnt waste the money on these, instead find one that has the wires covered up where the mixture wont get one them so it wont stop working the same day you get them. Or find something similar if they dont make them like that. Other than that my kids loved them just wish theyd make them different so they would last for more than a few hours unless you know how to get them working again. All these people that review these items before they come out need to be leaving feedback on what needs done or what to do so this would be prevented hopefully.

What I love about this product is how QUICKLY you can build a house, fence, maze, chair, etc. Instant fort! Of course my two year old can't really build anything yet, but she loves playing in whatever we create. I've included photos in my review and you can see that these blocks are stable enough for small kids (with parental supervision) to stand on. I had to buy a second set. One set is definetely not enough! I often bring these blocks with me to parties. They're a great icebreaker for that awkward children's birthday situation where you don't know anyone.

It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates.

I printed out the label and took it to the post office and it showed the company wanted me to pay for the shipping! The cost to ship it back was more than what I paid for the pool! I contacted the seller and they said I had to pay for the shipping because my reason for sending it back was because I didn't like it. But it was more about the damage and looking like I got a return from someone else, and I told them that! Also the inaccurate description, but mostly the damage! Whoever was emailing me back and forth was absolutely no help and told me I could send it back and pay for shipping or pretty much keep it and take my chances if its defective. He or she told me its \"my choice\". Real nice customer service! Even if it was because I didn't like the item, I still never took the pool out of the box because I was afraid it had holes in it and figured they could send me another one or refund me.

The pieces were just a touch thin for my taste, but that's purely personal preference. They were plenty sturdy and I didn't have any issues with bending or tearing.

There's also an odd spot here and there on the discs where the episode will stutter, freeze, or is missing. I've counted 3 instances of this so far and I've still got a season and a half to watch.

We started the potty training journey at 2-1/2 years then we had many life changes and interruptions and soon to embark on a move which might cause another setback but I\u2019m trying to get ahead of it. We tried rewards, taking privileges away, talking to her to see what we can do to help and why she doesn\u2019t make it to the potty in time. We finally decided on a potty watch at the beginning on October. It was a cheap one that sang but it worked very well when we kept it on the kitchen counter. I then sent her to school with it on her wrist hoping today would be they day we don\u2019t have an accident at school. It worked I picked her up no accident! When we got home I took the watch off and put it on the counter it never sang the rest of the day. Tried changing the batteries but still nothing. It must have gotten wet when she washed her hands. So that brings me to this watch, I needed something that wasn\u2019t a high tech game watch and not aother cheap one that will stop working when splashed on. CONS: Takes a bit of time to program and slightly confusing A bit bulky for my 4 year olds wrist More expensive than I wanted to pay The button is a bit tough for my daughter to press then the alarm vibrates The packaging in the box was already opened. It looked like I was sold a pre-owned used watch. The papers inside were bent, the face of the watch has scratches in it.

The arm is just awkward in general, particularly how it bends at the elbow. If you have a good grasp on anatomy then you can correct these issues in your drawing, but if you are a newer artist then this figure might be confusing to work with.

They also come with different size earbuds so there should be a set that should fit your ears too. You can change the volume while listening to music on the headphones and even skip or go to previous song as well. These headphones play music really loud and still keeps it at a pretty good clarity. I usually don't have them set at the highest volume since they're just really good at about 75% it's highest volume works for me. On top of that, the noise cancelation works really great as far as these kinds of headphones. And since these are waterproof, these are perfect for while taking a run. If you you're looking for good headphones for running, working out or even just to listen to music in general, I promise you won't regret buying these. Plus these come with a 1 year warranty.

They responded quickly however thats were the problems began. When we told the tech support person what the problem was, he immediately stated that the battery warrant for only 3 months. When we asked to email us the terms and conditions which state 3 month battery warranty, he backed off and couldn't provide in writing what he claimed initially (CYA). When we requested a replacement battery he asked that we go and PURCHASE a volt meter to test the battery. Imagine having to find a store, drive there and purchase the volt meter (would have cost more than just buying a new battery). When we stated we don't have one, but all symptoms point to a faulty battery and requested a replacement, he stated that although the battery isn't expensive he wouldn't do that. Since we got no satisfaction, and ended up frustrated, we bought a replacement battery on Amazon (about $20), replaced the battery and everything is now working well.

The thin box is not deal-breaker it is fine but I would prefer a little thicker box, however, the box insert for the cards is cartoonishly large so the cards go everywhere in the box. The included currency tokens are tiny light green rectangles that feel really cheap, I hazard to even call them tokens, it feels and looks like cheap gloss printer paper that feels bootleg. I would prefer it if instead, they gave paper money that was larger with some design at the bare minimum, however, ultimately at the price point of 28 or more dollars, I would expect at least decent quality currency tokens. Lacking a linen finish and being so thin at this price point is egregious if I was to compare the quality of the cards to playing cards and other cheap card-based games the quality is bottom of the barrel.

It is fun, but then the chances of actually getting air into this hammock is pretty low. There's just something about it that makes it so hard to put air into. There was only ONE time out of the 3 that I was actually able to put air into it and it was awesome!!! Other than that, it was not. It was too much work to put air into that I had to make it some kind of a game. I mean, there's just too big of a hole to close off when air is being put into the hammock. I can't say it can hold 440 pounds either. I think it was more like 200 pounds at the most. Any more than that, it will start to flatten. When it was inflated perfectly, many of us were able to hang on the sides and float around. Two of us were able to lay on it without drowning. The mesh actually stayed in one piece too. No rip whatsoever. The fastening of the buckle doesn't make sense to me, but if it works then that is all that matters. I just need to get used to the buckling, I guess. I gave this hammock 4 stars because the idea of a hammock that requires swinging around in a circle to put air into it is cool to me. When it is inflated, it is fun. When it is deflated, it is space saving. And when it is being used, it becomes a fun water activity. Just be careful with it though. The nylon and mesh feels thin, but it can still last a while if taken care of correctly and carefully. Thank you!", "review_title": "Ahhh!", "language": "en", "product_category": "toy"}

One table leg wasn\u2019t able to be tightened on and one of the chairs was seriously dangerous where the seat back attached to the chair... it was loose and the screws couldn\u2019t be tightened in completely. To their credit, I placed a request to have a new one sent and I\u2019d planned to return the damaged set. They did a priority shipment and it was delivered the same day. Kudos on that note, for sure. Now, when the 2nd table arrived, I began putting it together. All seemed well, until I got to the last leg of the 2nd chair where there was something wrong with the screw portion that connected it to the base of the chair. Couldn\u2019t get it to tighten and stay in with solid integrity. I would have been annoyed enough to send it back and not ask for a replacement the 2nd time, however I hadn\u2019t shipped the first defective set back yet. Fortunately, one of the chair legs from the original damaged set, worked perfectly with the new set. So, it\u2019s put together properly and is very sturdy. I would recommend this table set because when you get it all worked out and put together properly, it\u2019s very sturdy and was ultimately what I was looking for when I originally ordered it. I\u2019d suggest that if you do order this table, if the 1st one comes partially damaged and you order a replacement set, wait to ship the damaged one back until you get the replacement set successfully put together. With 2 sets, you\u2019re bound to end up with all the proper functioning parts. It\u2019s a great little table and chairs set for the price, and Lord knows, I price shopped the snot out of these things. Seems as if this is a common complaint about this particular table / chairs set... but again, customer service was pretty awesome and they were extremely quick to attempt to rectify the issues.

Even worse, the mounting hardware has some very sharp edges that cut fingers and fray the ropes on the obstacles. The constant tightening/releasing of the line also puts a lot of additional use onto the ratchet mechanism.

Bought this for my 10 month old who likes \"figuring things out\" and is very into switches and putting things in/taking them out. To my disappointment, her reaction to this has been very meh. In addition, the design is not great - it's too light weight so every time she pushes down on one of the \"arms\" it tips over. I also wish the edges of the holes where the balls go into were softer/more rounded. It's really easy for the hard plastic ridge to pinch her fingers if she's holding onto the ball while pushing it in. As others have said, the spring/click feature on the purple/green balls isn't great either. One of ours works well, the other usually only pops out about halfway and only about half the time.

I could not stop it before it cam completely off. After about an hour and a half i had fixed the motor and had it remounted. What happened was the motor got extremely hot and melted itself out of the drone. I believe this was due to the wrong prop being used on that motor.

Otherwise they were really tight on the mounting screw. This also I think aided in the motor over heating.

Here's why, To get a replacement product you must make a video of any issues you are having with Holy Stone Drones, then you must upload the video to you tube and then sit and wait for an answer. Then IF your complaint goes in your favor they will ask you what kind of replacement you want. They won't replace this particular model for many different excuses. Then when you inform them of what you want they will (at least that's what happened to in this case) tell you they don't have that one either. Can't remember what cheap low end model they were trying to push, but that's what happened in this case. So we still haven't received any resolution to the issue. There are other brands out there, don't waste your time with Holy Stone. Oh, almost forgot, this particular model (there were two bought) have the following problems. Speed control doesn't work Sluggish controls Won't do a 360 flip Ability to control lift and land not functioning I'll have to get back with the camera, haven't tried it yet.

I had to look very closely two different times to figure out where the wrong piece was and that was frustrating.

It is meant to steal the opponents spin. Stickers are included to apply yourself.

Right from the start, we had problems putting the batteries in because the screw to the battery bay is apparently manufactured from butter, stripping even with a lightweight, handheld screw driver. When we finally managed to get batteries into the thing, my son played with it for about 4 minutes before, out of frustration, he just put it aside. My older sons tried to have fun with it and teach him how to properly drive it, but they, too, gave up. When I tried to use it myself, I found the controls very non-intuitive, especially if you've ever used an RC car before. The two thumbsticks operate more like a tank or a zero-radius riding lawn mower, except unlike RC tanks I've driven in the past, to turn, you have to remember to leave the opposite stick absolutely neutral, or the car does this jerky, motor-stepping spasm. On top of that, the tires, quite thin-walled and flimsy, keep coming off the rims. Meanwhile, the battery panel on the controller falls off frequently. We haven't even bothered to make the thing flip yet, as we can't even have fun just driving it around normally! Overall, a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to warn others to stay away. There's a reason this product is so inexpensive. It's poorly conceived, and poorly made. You'll be much better off dropping 10-20 bucks more on an RC car your kid will actually get some enjoyment out of.", "review_title": "A poorly conceived, poorly made product", "language": "en", "product_category": "toy"}

Bought it for my son (7 y.o.) for Christmas. The speed is a little bit fast for inside the house but not overly fast for outside. It's a good compromise speed, especially for younger kids. It does drive over grass well if the grass is fairly short and handles moderate obstacles well. Turning is finicky sometimes (sometimes it doesn't respond to the controller when you try to turn it). The battery life seems a bit on the short side to me, but we were using it outside in sub-freezing weather, so that will reduce battery life. My biggest complaint is the connector for the battery. You have to clip in into a small connector in the car and on the charger. The connection is hard to release and I foresee it getting torn up when attempting to release it. You have to remove the battery from the car every time to charge it, which is also a hassle.

Will easily hold up to average sized adults. Spins easily. CONS Little too short Doesn't slide well The learning \"tricks\" advertisement is mostly BS I bought this for my 6 yo daughter because she is learning to snowboard and wakeboard, and I thought this would be a good practice tool. She also has some issues with ankle strength due to medical issues, and I thought this might be a fun PT tool. Out of the box she was excited about, because it does look cool. The shape is okay for practicing balance on a hard surface, but that's about the extent of the capabilities. It doesn't work well on carpet, and will scratch a hardwood floor, so keep that in mind. It will spin like the videos show, but it also a little small for even a 6 yo to sit on. We tried to use it as a training tool for wakeboarding in the yard, but the surface is not slick enough to slide across grass (even down a fairly steep hill). It may work okay as a tiny sled in snowy conditions, but it's not really big enough even for a 42 lb 6 yo to sit on while sledding. As I mentioned above, it is quite durable. I'm slightly over 200 lbs, and it holds me up fine. The stuff about practicing skateboarding tricks is mostly marketing bunk.

I appreciate his responsiveness and willingness to try and make things right. I remain concerned that the part broke in the first place, however, as it put my child and potentially others at risk of serious injury. If you want to use this set, I recommend approaching with caution, and communicating with the seller immediately regarding any concerns. ORIGINAL REVIEW: As big fans of the show American Ninja Warrior, my kids were eager to try out this course. After only the third use, one of the wooden swinging bars cracked and broke, causing my daughter to fall several feet and land on her head. She weighs about 60 pounds, well under the weight limit for this product, so I have to conclude that this set was defective. I will be returning it and am going to insist upon a full refund.

If you jam the doors closed so they don\u2019t pop open then the girls can\u2019t get them open. I have to figure how to work that problem out.

They sound like about a 10-second recording in a continuous loop, except there is a gap in the loop so you can tell where the loop begins and ends. Furthermore, whenever you turn off the lightsaber, it says a word (lightsabers aren't supposed to talk!), and as near as I can tell, the word it says is \"SLEEPING.\" 2) This saber can't be upgraded or customized, other than replacing the blade. 3) The blade is not very strong or thick. You'll need to buy a replacement blade if you want to do any dueling at all. 4) Only one control button to handle all of the myriad functions. 5) No instruction manual! You need instructions in order to use that single button to activate a half a dozen different features. The only place to find instructions is online, at the manufacturer's Facebook page, so if you're not a Facebook user, you're SOL because you'll never figure out on your own how to make ONE SINGLE CONTROL button do all the different functions!
