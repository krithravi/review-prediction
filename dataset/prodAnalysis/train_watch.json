My everyday wear is high-end handcrafted expensive Spanish or Italian dress clothes. I can say, it even looks good with them, and anything else. I'm very particular to my purchases, and I am 100% happy with this one. I am an average sized guy, normal arms and wrist. Face is sized very nice and accordingly. This watch displays everything necessary, with a not too bright light that enables you to see in any condition. Good for nighttime so as to not blind you. I like the contrast of the shiny face casing and smooth matte stainless steel band. When clean, the face has a shine that looks beautiful. Also, I oddly prefer digital to any Rolex cause it gives me a different perception and feel, of time. Just the right weight and durability. I've used the alarm a few times, worked great.

For the last three years I have been wearing a first generation Apple Watch. The Fossil performs as advertised and I am happy with the purchase. Battery charge is as advertised. For example, today I put the watch on at 4:15 a.m. and at 3:00 p.m. I have 75% of the battery charge left. Yesterday, I put the watch on at 4:30 a.m. and at 10:00 p.m. had 53% of the charge left. That means that I am getting better than 24 hours of use per charge. This has to be qualified, though. The Emerald Sequoia watch faces are gorgeous and these are the only ones I have been wearing. I switch out all 21 faces depending upon what information I want to see for a while. I read all the material at the Emerald Sequoia web site and in the section regarding ambient watch faces they explain that predominantly black watch faces use less battery than white, so most of the time I have a darker face selected, unless I want certain info from another face. Also, I don\u2019t need a high brightness on the face, so I either turn the brightness down to level 2 or use the automatic setting to let the watch self-adjust to ambient lighting. I do have all notifications turned on, but that only gets me email, messages, and notifications from Sky Safari Pro. So, I do use features that conserve battery, but over the entire day I have no problem with the battery. Wifi is on, but I can\u2019t tell whether or not the watch uses it, and the watch is always connected to my iPhone 8 Plus. I suspect those connections use some charge, but apparently not much. One more thing is that with first use I was disappointed with the battery keeping a charge and didn\u2019t think it was as good as the first generation Apple Watch. But I did a complete factory reset the second day, as was suggested on some Wear OS blog that I read, and that seemed to fix any problems. When I go to bed at night the watch goes on the charger and is 100% when I wake up early in the morning.", "review_title": "Emerald Sequoia Astronomy Watch Faces", "language": "en", "product_category": "watch"}

So, I removed it and tried some extra straps I had. They did not fit, as they were too thick! Due to the design\u2019s recessed lugs, the space is tight and will only accommodate a THIN 22 mm strap! I had to really go through Amazons selection to find one that will work. One positive, during the removal/ replacement of the spring bars it is difficult not to nick the watch finish.

The watch looks exceptional nice and stylish. It looks like one of those watches we spend 100's on but for the quarter of the price. The quality is amazing it has actual stainless steel in the back, which is great so she doesn't have to worry about rusting as she sometimes wears her watch to gym as well. It came with this small screw which i wasn't sure about but turns out it can be used to open the back and change the battery if needed. Even the expensive watches doesn't give you that.
