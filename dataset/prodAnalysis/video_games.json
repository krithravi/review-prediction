The trailer you might've watched for this game? Yeah... you can't play that game in VR. For VR you get about a half hour tutorial which, once you pass, will unlock a free paint mode. You're mostly painting 2D on walls but there is one level that you can paint in 3D. I don't know the relationship between the non-VR main story and this painting mode and I'm not going to play it to find out. I feel cheated! At best the description of this game is misleading. From the description on the product page you can't really tell what you'll get. I hope this review helps to deter anyone buying this game to only play in VR. Maybe this game is great in 2D but that's not what I was looking for. So, this game is more like Ace Combat 7 VR \"mode included\" where you play a few VR levels but not the actual game, and not at all like Resident Evil Biohazard VR \"mode included\", where you play the entire game in VR but have to watch a few cutscenes in 2D. I think Sony needs to come up with a third tier of branding for VR games like this...maybe say \"VR Content Included\", which would signify that you can't play the game in VR but you can do extra stuff that you'll need a VR headset/camera for.

Unfortunately, he didn't open until recently sometime in the middle of May this month, so I'm well past the return period for this product. It did not work at all. The fans didn't work, the USB ports were very snug and hard to put USBs into, and I tried seeing if the stand could still charge controllers and it didn't. I couldn't see if the controllers were charging for the 2 stations since they're upside-down and I wasn't able to see the charging light for the controllers, so I tried connecting one with a USB cable and there was no indication from my controller that the charge stand was even working at all.

I bought this game primarily to play the multiplayer with friends, but played through the campaign to get a feel for the game. Graphics are okay, no better than par for the course at this point (Battlefield's are slightly better). Frequent display glitches where the top 25% of the screen would lag or break pretty consistently during cutscenes. Story is unimpressive and the overly aggressive CO gets old extremely quick. Gameplay was choppy at best, seems there's a cutscene or a change of perspective every time you start to build any momentum. The health pack system made the play very frustrating - most levels are played something like: pop two shots, find cover, use health pack, repeat. Simply not very satisfying completing the campaign. Multiplayer is as bad as others have described. If you have someone else living with you who does not appreciate you yelling at the screen constantly, for their sake, do not buy this game. Laggy, inconsistent, and frustrating. As I mentioned earlier, I bought the game to play multiplayer with friends. The party system is an absolute mess. It's nearly impossible to play with friends. First, you have to change default settings to join parties at all, and if you're lucky enough to successfully create or join a party, you're likely to end up in entirely different games. I'd estimate I've successfully played the same match as my friends no more than 20% of the time.

When it worked, the most annoying thing was the USB cable, it tended to get loose from the controller frequently, not sure if that is the port or the cable. Didn't try out the extra joysticks, though I did switch out the D Pads and didn't have much of a preference since I wasn't playing any fighting games. I didn't use the extra mapping buttons either, just never decided what to use them for. The controller definitely feels great and enjoyed it while it lasted. I turned off the Chroma as I just found it distracting and kinda annoying when it would light up the room more than the light from the TV.

However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic.

All the research said this was an awesome game and if I enjoyed certain other titles (Elder Scrolls series, Diablo series, etc) that I would likely enjoy this too. Because many of the reviews mentioned the same games that I loved, I probably had my hopes to high and was a little let down. I only put in about 40 hours but even at that it comes out to 50 cents an hour of time/money so definitely can;t complain. As soon as something else caught my attention, I had no problem putting the game down. The game play, in and of itself, was not bad. I found the loot grabbing system a bit wonky and hard to see (even after adjusting contrast, etc). The battle system was not complex and easy to grasp but I felt there could have been more to it. Where I felt this game really failed was the upgrade system. Upgrading weapons and armor was not intuitive and took a bit to figure out. One thing I did enjoy was having the ability to let others use your toon (character) to fight in their game and when you updated (slept at inn, etc) your character would come back with new knowledge. The honor system of giving used toons stuff to bring back with them fails as no one ever sends stuff back. Luckily, the experience and quest knowledge they brought back was typically useful.

First it was that his PSN id wouldn't work because you have to buys PSN+ specifically for the Vita user (can't just use the \"family\" plan like you ought to), then after shelling out money for a second PSN+ we find out that none of the games will fit in the on-board memory! It's ridiculous! Crappy product design aside, the memory card did what it was supposed to. Once installed, my son was FINALLY able to play the free games from PSN+ as well as the few games he bought digitally. If you already have a PS Vita, and need more memory to store games, this will work just fine. If you are on the fence about buying a PS Vita DON'T. It's a beautiful turd that Sony has no intension of polishing.", "review_title": "The PS Vita has proven to be the WORST thing Sony has every birthed into this world", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}

I\u2019ve worked for AT&T and Apple and several of my customers always had tempered glass screen protectors. I was always afraid to use them because I didn\u2019t know how easy it would be to get them off. I decided to get one because this is just too expensive to have a simple film. It was fairly easy to put on, but getting the dust off is a pain. That\u2019s not a detractor for this protector, though. The reason I\u2019m only giving this four stars is because I think tempered glass screen protectors are a gimmick after my first experience with them. I think it\u2019s lovely that they give you to just in case one breaks or you make a mistake. However, because I didn\u2019t make a mistake, I took off the first one and put on the second. In doing so, the first one slid off the couch and fell to the tile at a distance of about 2 feet. When I say it fell, I actually mean it gently glided down to the floor. When I went to clean up the mess from all of the paper, plastic, and cleaning supplies, I noticed that the first screen protector was completely shattered. There are many reviews saying that this screen protector saves the device, prevented it from shattering, etc. I don\u2019t buy it. If it shattered from a height of 2 feet, then it really seems unnecessary for the purpose of protecting your screen from shattering. It will definitely protect against scratches, but that is the only reason that I would purchase this.", "review_title": "Gimmicky", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}

The stickers for pulling off dust can be a little tacky, but I solved that problem by sticking it to my countertop first to take a little of the \"bite\" out of it. Worked great for removing little flecks of dust. Screens went on mostly bubble-free after that, I was able to use the bubble card to push out all but a couple of small ones. Usually those are caused by improper cleaning before you put on the screen protector, as was likely the case for me. Overall, the protectors fit well and there are no issues with glare/unresponsiveness. Even my 6-year-old was happy to have a little something extra to protect his new (and hopefully last) 2DS XL.

There are plenty of reviews telling you the good stuff which I mostly agree with. So I'm going to list my gripes about this case first. They definitely could have given people who protect their Switch some leeway where the Switch rests. I prefer to keep a shell on my Switch whenever I'm not using the dock and silicone covers on the joycons at all times, and with both of those on it was a crazy snug fit, if the strap wasn't there to help pop it out I think I would have problems getting my switch out of there. So I keep my joycons in the pouch and just the screen on the bottom to make things fit better, plus its quicker to slide the screen into the self folding standing like that for me. On the opposite side of things, the accessory pouch on top actually has too much room in my opinion. Although this ranges depending on what accessories you're actually wanting to bring with you. The power adapter sits perfectly fine and stays put, however while I only have two joycons to test and not four or more, there's no real way to strap them in there, so they can easily shimmy around and possibly fall out somewhat easily. You can bring a generous amount of game carts with you, but the direction placement seems like a design oversight because the game carts hang downward, especially if you were actually carrying the case around by the handle. After one short walking trip I found half the game carts I had in there were halfway about the fall out. If they were flip it the other way then the games would hang while you had it in stand mode, but that's much better having the games jostled around and coming a bit loose if you were carrying it by the handle. I only have this case in mind for actual console and game transfer rather than toting it around, so this also isn't a huge deal. Other than those two gripes, this case is awesome. The fold out stand is wonderful to have. It rests on a soft material and it supports the Switch well. I use it more than the crappy plastic HORI stand I bought a long time ago. I do wonder if its wise to rely on it for long play sessions though, because the cutouts for the vents in the back could be bigger, and I'm not sure if having a protective case on it like in my pictures might cause unnecessary overheating, but its still a great option to have and a standout feature. As far as actual protecting your switch goes? I'm confident an honest accidental drop on the ground will keep your Switch nice and safe, even if the case landed on concrete. Water proof? I honestly don't suggest you keep this by the swimming pool or bathtub and hoping it protects from an accidental submerge, but if someone unluckily spilled something on the case, I believe everything inside will be protected just fine. I may have sounded harsh on this product, but it is incredibly worth it if you want a case that carries the Switch, the power adapter, a few joycons and a lot of games all at once while having the outside material actually being tough enough to protect them all.", "review_title": "I was in love, at first..", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}

I found a good mix, but it took some playing with. I love that i feel totally immersed in games now because the audio is louder than my last headset. Windows Sonic really shines in game allowing you to pinpoint exactly what direction sound is coming from. Played Destiny and PUBG. PUBG made a big difference. Mic monitoring isn't really great, the mic has to be really close to you mouse and you barely hear yourself. I did randomly loose sync for a couple second about 2-3 times within about 5 hours of use.

Would have been 5 stars but the exclusion of a third person option is somewhat problematic for me...but is my only complaint. What is good: 1. Single player. No shared world..multiplayer battle royale BS. 2. No internet required. I have extremely powerful internet in my home. Don't tell me I have to connect to play a game I just spent $60 on and will not be able to play again after it is no longer supported. 3. Acceptable character creation and options. Would have been even better with a 3rd person view. 4. Well thought out story line with good lore and back drop. Cant be completely comprehensive on that as I am only 12 hours in. 5. Beautiful and colorful scenery. Tongue in cheek humor in some of the presentation as well as the dialogue. 6. A real RPG with relevant choices that turn the direction of the game.

I don't suffer from any mental illness that I'm aware of, but it does a great job of simulating the anxiety and fear that I assume pairs with these disorders. The game looks nice. It says it has HDR. It's obviously not made by a AAA engine, but for a third party small studio it's very impressive and beyond what anyone should expect from an indie title. The sound is fantastic (it suggests wearing headphones but I think this would be too intense for me) and the areas you explore are perfectly spooky and ominous. The story itself is great and shines over all the other aspects. The game play is why I reduced a star. It's not immediately obvious how to make things happen, and can be frustrating to navigate at times. The combat seems unreasonably difficult even on the easiest setting... Games with heavy emphasis on narration should always include a \"very easy\" mode in my opinion. Replaying segments you've failed takes away from the immersion and replaces it with frustration. It really takes away from the fun of the story unfolding. I do believe there should be options to ramp up the difficulty for those inclined, but when I'm trying to unveil a story (think uncharted or God of War) repeating a difficult combat sequence 4 or 5 times significantly takes away from the fun. All in all this is an impressive game, and I encourage you to push forward through the difficult parts to see the ending. The story is well worth the temporary frustration.", "review_title": "Good and scary", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}

I adjust the headset to make my dominate eye (right eye) is clear and my left eye will look a little fuzzy, but my brain adjusts. It's not perfect, but I get used to it. I really wish there was a way to adjust the IPD mechanically. I'm planning on upgrading to a Valve Index in the future because of the manual IPD adjust. Until then, this headset works just fine. I do love the controllers, and I believe they're the best on market in my opinion. Main reason I don't want to switch to Valve is not only because they're way too expensive, but the controller sucks compared to Oculus. Other than that, it was very easy to setup, I encountered very few bugs. If you close a game out, sometimes it doesn't shut down properly and you'll have to reboot your computer. The headset speakers are trash. I recommend just using headphones or just use desktop speakers if you're playing a music game like Beat Saber. These have the worst speakers on the market, they're like 2 watt 1990's speakers that come with your Compaq Presario. Not even joking, they're a step up from internal motherboard speakers.", "review_title": "My IPD is 70", "language": "en", "product_category": "video_games"}
