The caps close so tight that everyday we have to wrestle with the bottle to open the cap. With a baby in one hand opening the cap is a night mare. And on top of these extra ordinary features of super secure cap, they are so expensive when compared to other brands. Stay away from these until they fix the cap issues. We have hurt ourselves many time trying to open caps as they have sharp edges on the inner and outer edges. Not worth the price.", "review_title": "Not worth the price and very bad cap design", "language": "en", "product_category": "baby_product"}

Finally, I had a few hours to set it up & it took me all of 1 hour to do so. I'm a pretty technical person, so I thought it'd be simple. After I finally got it set up the orange error light kept flashing & will NOT print. We've tried EVERY single troubleshooting option there is, you tube troubleshooting, etc to no avail. Now I'm stuck with a defective printer & wasted time I cannot get back. Needless to say I am beyond frustrated with this Canon.", "review_title": "I do not recommend this printer", "language": "en", "product_category": "office_product"}
