I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back.

I mean, I can't say I expected it to be overwhelmingly amazing with the cost being where it's at. But, certainly I thought it would last longer than a few days. Had the phone in my gym bag. Slid out from the side and barely tapped the wall. On the aluminum side. Not even on the glass. And low and behold, instantaneous crack. Oddly enough, just on the back. Not a splinter at all on the front. Not sure if the back is intentionally more susceptible to damage or just my luck. Either way, I have to give this product a thumbs down. Wish it held up better. It really is a nice design. I am a fan of how the product looks and the concept. No issue there.
